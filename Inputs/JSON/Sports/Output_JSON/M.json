			"We could create a sport where it can have some certain aspects of other sports in it. It could be where you have two different teams with 6 or 7 on each team. There could be certain time limits like quarters or halves (Like two 20 minute halves or four 10 minute quarters). Played over a distance of 50 yards, so half  the length and width of a football field and could be played on an actual football field. There would be an end zone for each team which they are trying to get a football across. Instead of being able to run freely like you can in football, you could only be allowed like 3 or 4 steps then could pick a pivot foot like there is in basketball. The defense wouldn't be able to grab the ball from the person holding it. For the defense to steal the ball the ball would either have to be deflected, intercepted on a pass, or be thrown away by the team that's on offense (like say team 1 tries to throw to another member on team 1 and the person doesn't catch it, then team 2 would get the ball where the ball was thrown, or something like that! But if team 2 knocks the ball down on a pass, team 1 would still have the ball.) or get the ball after the other team scores in their end zone. It could be continuous play unless stopped by an official. If players are playing dirty or rough they can get certain levels of warnings until they get ejected. There could be a certain amount of timeouts per half (like 1 or 2). Substitutes can be subbed in and subbed during a pause in play. Say after team 1 scores, team two could get the ball at team 1's end zone and work their way towards their end zone. Points will just be like 1, 2, 3... etc."
