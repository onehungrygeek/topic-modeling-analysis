The point of the game is to get a small, lightweight ball through the hoop suspended in the air. I think what would make the game hard enough to be a sport is that the hoop is suspended well over the players' reach, the ball is lightweight, and the racket the players hold will be harder to maneuver because they're long."

The point of the game is to make the other team drop the ball. The ball would be volleyball-basketball weight, because a lightweight ball would give the players a lot of time to get the the ball before it touches the ground. Each time the ball touches the ground, a player of the team's side that the ball fell on, would have to sit on the sideline, making the rest of the players try harder to win. Either the players can't hold the ball at all, only tap or hit it up like in \"don't let the balloon touch the ground\"m or they can only hold it for 1 second. The team with the most players left at the end of 30 minutes wins."
