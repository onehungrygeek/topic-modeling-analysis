			"a mixture of baseball, and kickball, there are 2 teams, each consisting of 10 or more players. Just like in Baseball, the defensive team is in the outfield, on the bases, the mound, and behind home plate. The offensive team has on member of the team come up to home plate, he has a choice to either kick the ball or hit it with a flat bat, however the player has no idea what the pitcher is wanting the through it could be hittable or kickable. instead of running to the right like in Baseball, the player will run to the right (clockwise), the defensive team has to either catch the ball before it hits the ground, tag 1st base, or tag the runner. there are 3 outs, and 10 innings. When the offensive player is at Home base, he\/she has 3 outs, and 4 balls. if you get 4 balls, you get to safely go to 1st base, however if you get 3 outs, well, you're out. To score, just like in baseball, and kickball you have to circle the bases, tagging each one to move to the next base, then to Home base, that would be considered one point, per runner to home."
