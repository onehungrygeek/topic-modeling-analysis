Not literally of course, but perhaps a sort that uses hover technology, like what is recently coming out to deliver packages, to propel players through the air. It could a be an intense form of tag, or like in Harry Potter, a kind of ball game. What would be be entertaining however would be a game that involves a race through the air, through hoops around a cray track. It could be a team effort where a two teams of five players try to out smart each other to win the race as they fly. One player could be the person who vies for speed and agility, trying to get ahead. Two others could be a sort of defense, protecting the other players from getting knocked off the course and the last two would help offense, propelling the lead players toward victory across the finish line. I think it would be quite intense to watch, especially with the added bonus of players being pushed off the track and having to catch up."
