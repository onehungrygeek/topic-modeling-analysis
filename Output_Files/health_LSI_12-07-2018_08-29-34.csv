36,0,1578.22 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care."

38,3,18.33 %,"doctor, patient, not, pay, healthcare, people, do, insurance, system, time",I think the generic should be get off to let the main one reduce in cost
39,0,79.42 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",This would reduce the cost of the prescribed drug then people would be able to afford it as well as have the oppurtunity to actually buy the medication that they need to take on a regular basis.
40,0,67.63 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",More clinics similar to Care-Now should be open but they should have family medicine doctors there so that misdiagnosing will be less likely to occur and the prescribing of drugs will be less likely to happen
41,3,131.44 %,"doctor, patient, not, pay, healthcare, people, do, insurance, system, time",Physicians should be monitored on what and how much they are prescribing to their patients because this may crack down on them getting certain drugs for promotional purposes and receiving things from the drug companies that they would normally not get if they were not prescribing these drugs. It is all about the money in these cases so some doctors really are not considered with their patients health.
42,0,61.47 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",Less immunizations might help people to actually be able to fight off some of these diseases that they are trying to prevent from coming back since new ones are introduced all the time.
43,5,6.61 %,"system, healthcare, insurance, pay, time, care, health, fix, call, emergency",More studies should go into looking at the patterns and trends of certain outbreaks globally and try to figure out a way to prevent them from continuously spreading.
44,3,94.19 %,"doctor, patient, not, pay, healthcare, people, do, insurance, system, time","HIV/AIDS patients should get coupons on their medications and also have an affordable specialized doctor to visit for regular check-ups. Also, they can be used for the process of trying to find a cure for the disease."
45,0,61.18 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",More restrictions should be placed on receiving Medicaid so that people who are lazy and really just want to rely on the government for help will be less likely to get it.

To the LGBT community, they also needs to be treated equally to other people regardless race, age, background, etc. And this is the task of the health care providers who are responsible in providing them the best quality health service. People who is in the Nursing home would be suffered so many problems and can't get away from aging, so they need to have a good care even about mental, physical, and social health treatment to make them enjoy the rest of life. It should be more health care show or programs as many health issue commercials to everyone to make an announcement or warning about any thing related to health like overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, STDs, HIV thread, etc. There are now many and many case of rape related in the healthcare system, so it needs to pass a law or some restriction rules to reduce this issue as guaranteed the good working environment to all healthcare employees."
48,0,212.11 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","Yes, but not all people are like what you say.

50,0,122.41 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","I agree. Although healthcare covers most things, these specialized areas shouldn't be neglected, and should also recieve the same ammount of care, if not more, than the amount given in general healthcare."
51,0,76.42 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",Regular check ups on physicians should be required to make sure that they still have morals and values and really do care about the patients rather than they're paychecks.
52,3,69.34 %,"doctor, patient, not, pay, healthcare, people, do, insurance, system, time",The new technology would also reduce the amount of time that surgery would or regular everyday visits would take. Also with new things coming out there should be seminars for them to be displayed so that the doctors have a chance of purchasing them.
53,0,126.89 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",Support groups for people that are chronically ill should be provided by the government so that they have a better chance of thriving in life and not just to know that other people suffer but that they can help each other live a healthier lifestyle to try and relieve some pain and maybe even live longer.
54,0,128.98 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",If Medicare/Medicaid would crack down on the system and actually administer to the people who need it then taxes would probably go down because the government would not have to put so much money towards the healthcare system.
55,0,83.76 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","Assistant living for the elderly should be more affordable so that the nursing homes will not be so crowded, because some elderly people resort to the nursing home since that is all they're insurance will cover."
56,0,58.69 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",Maintaining a good healthcare system is the key reason so maybe the government should really evaluate this area more than all the other ones.
57,0,390.64 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","The budget for the healthcare services is reducing. So it needs to be considered to increase that amount of money. If the citizens are healthy, that means the country is also ""healthy"" too. Some new researches in Health science should be encouraged and granted by the governments or other foundations help the young new scientists to find the new methods and better cures for the patients or even a whole healthcare systems. Working hard will Many people are complaining about the healthcare insurance, not Medicare or Medicaid, so, there has to be some social benefits to qualify for those who are not getting enough financial supports for it. There must be some new hospitals build to server enough for the increasing patients where the old one is insufficient and does not well-qualified for the whole service. Any specialists or nurses who violate the policy or rules must be charged based on the scale of what errors they make during the healthcare services as will be a good model for others to obey and minimize the errors from little to zero."

61,0,115.46 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","Yes I agree. In doing so, it would also reduce the funds required for those who don't care as much, for funding should only go to those who actually care."
62,0,110.12 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","This method sounds pretty solid in my opinion. The only problem is that sometimes there are more sick people than anticipated, and there isn't enough healthcare to deal with the amount of sickness that is presented."
63,0,230.19 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","As technology grows more advanced day after day, at some point there is going to be a way to monitor all of those who truly need healthcare. Hopefully people can do all of the necessary things to get the help they need, and get on track to becoming healthier. At this time, there should also be enough medication and staff to deal with those that need healthcare, for without the staff and supplies, healthcare will decrease, and more people will remain sick and die. At the rate technology is evolving, there should already be a system, unfortunately not everyone can be trusted with medication and the help that the staff provides."
64,0,23.79 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","But it will be very difficult to draw the line of what will fit under ""emergency"" if those visits are free completely. It should probably be at a more reasonable cost instead."
65,0,56.07 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","I think medical research is a big factor in providing adequate healthcare. More funding should be available to researchers to find cures for diseases, new techniques for procedures, new drugs, and ways to prevent illnesses."
66,0,136.29 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","I don't think that having a pharmacy and physician together will really make that much of a difference. there are more important things than making it ""convenient"" for the patient so they don't have to drive to a pharmacy.

72,0,190.46 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","Money could be a reason why for both. There should be a better investment for healthcare.

74,0,182.65 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","In a touchy subject, healthcare has become too political. It's main focus should be the well being of sick, disabled and retired people.

75,4,268.71 %,"healthcare, people, pay, make, insurance, healthy, care, time, food, service","What if there was healthcare for a range of income? Or is there already? If there isn't then why not have higher income families pay a portion towards healthcare that they can afford, and then lower income families pay a portion that they can afford. It would be healthcare for all in a sense, but all of us would pay a different amount. A reasonable amount. ? :)"
76,0,127.28 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",I personally believe that healthcare in this country is too expensive and frankly people on a budget do not see it necessary to obtain one. I believe that minor health problems should be free.

83,0,484.67 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","I agree that the education about the health care system should be improved. I don't think it's a problem because people remain that way because they can't afford it. Yes, some people may choose not to learn more about it, but that's cause they might not feel the need to and that's why they feel less informed when asked about changes/improvements to the healthcare system. For example, young adults who are covered for healthcare by their parent's employers don't feel the need to learn about health care because they don't have to pay for it and it's not a concern for them."

89,0,492.95 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","i think that most health care professionals try to focus on the sick, disabled, and retired people, but because many people don't have insurances or enough insurance, when they use medical services, those services aren't paid for.  Since they aren't paid for then the drs' nurses' medical profs. have to be mindful of money and services.  ideally money would have no part of receiving medical aide/help, but in reality, someone has to pay for services.  if no one pays, then services are less ""good"" or non-existent"

In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education. Education would help reduce the work load through people going to where they are suppose to go for a given emergency, not to mention them themselves eating healthier, treating themselves better, etc..."

America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it. What a caring doctor should prescribe is a dose of ""lay off on the McDonalds"", work out regularly and choose to be healthy.

Start manufacturing the medication here in the US to make it more affordable.

Why struggle more than we have to? The monster that stands in the way is greed. Anyway... Ideally, CEOs would still make enough of their share to afford their extra cake/comfortability while entry-level employees would actually be able to afford the health care the companies boast about offering. If there were some type of ratio that limited how much a business owner could make versus a cashier, I'd be for it. Example: At a time, Ben and Jerry's ice cream company had a 7 to 1 ratio. (The numbers off the top of my head might not be exact, but it is the point that matters.) At any time, the owners could only make seven times more than the lower workers.

It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early.

The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult.

Sweden, if you are a born citizen, you get to go to college for free. this is how it should be here in America. with a smarter population, health care would take care of itself. people would be able to afford their own health care. also we might become a top country once again. i still think their needs to be competition into what college a person attends though, otherwise college would be like high school, just a right of passage."

Youtube and television programs are already gaining popularity with Dr. Oz and amateur youtube stars. If awareness is spread of fitness, more people would be less likely to fall ill to complications like heart disease and diabetes. Appeals to many different types of audiences would need to be tried. For kids, maybe, the focus should be how physical activity can be fun and friendly. For adults, say we focus on the logical health benefits to being fit.

Of course, why the heck do people use Vicodin or Purple drank? 5)Nothing in the world would really change, because illegality of marijuana hasn't done a darn thing to stop it.

1504,0,63.21 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system",There would have to be an incentive because insurance companies most likely would not want to cover such Rx eventhough it would be to there advantage saving payments for more costly procedures later on.

For example if a physician can get a diabetes 2 patient off of meds (although it is not curable) to where the patient has been educated and has their disease under control or managed- government should give physicians tax breaks on this because it would cost government less to pay for a low income persons meds.

In Germany is a health insurance mandatory and this is right. Life is not predictable and every day something bad can happen to everybody. Because of this, the U.S needs a mandatory health insurance.

Why effect directly those who can afford their own insurance? Giving equality to patients in deciding which doctors to see, this being Socialist! Also punishing doctors who take payment privately. If i have more money, and work harder, or maybe even am a little luckier, I should see whichever doctor I can afford. If I do not make enough to see that doctor, then I have to tough up and see the next one, and so on until I can afford one. This is how the world works, you get what you pay for.

Forcing every American to buy insurance, lying by saying that the penalties of not doing so is a tax. You can read the health care plan after it is passed???? This is terrifying, that the average American will stand for this, and reelect the same individuals responsible, and their excuse, "" Well at least they are trying"". 40% of americans are on some form of government assistance, and the president keeps saying that things are getting better, and more and more americans are out of work, many illegals receive free healthcare, while not paying taxes. Many americans receive benefits while sitting on their -----, and not contributing in their lifetimes while everyone else has to. As said by a famous scholar, every democracy will die, once its people realize that they can elect themselves benefits, or as we may know it ""freebees"".

This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living."

On this truck you could also apply for healthcare and talk to representatives that can provide help to those who don't know what their doing or could be doing to make their situation better. you could maybe find a way to teach kids about healthcare in school so that they can be prepared for their future responsibilities.

Americans complain and complain they had a 100 dollar co-pay. Why are you complaining, the meds cost a heck of a lot more to research, develop, get a approved... hell im not going to explain the business process here, you get it.

Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy."

However, most people with low incomes aren't able to afford all of the necessary things it takes to stay healthy like buying Organic foods, gym memberships, and supplements, etc. So these people are forced to either pay a higher insurance rate or have none at all. I do agree that there should be an incentive to leading a healthy lifestyle and maybe if gym memberships or ""healthy food"" discounts were offered through our employers or insurance companies it would help aid to a healthier lifestyle where healthcare wasn't such a burden."

Quality;          Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.  I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have."

1964,0,48.16 %,"people, health, care, healthcare, pay, not, insurance, make, doctor, system","reform our educational system in a way that once someone enters high school (after their freshman year so they can get a feel for how school is) they are forced to choose whether they want to further pursue a college degree or enter the work force right out of school. After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someone  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more. For far too long have I seen students in high school being taught math and science they never use in day to day activities when they don't even plan to go to college this education of these subjects to people who choose to enter the workforce waste so much time doing this that they have to wait and have no experience in how to get the jobs and once they do get the job they don't know how to do the required tasks in an adequate manner."
