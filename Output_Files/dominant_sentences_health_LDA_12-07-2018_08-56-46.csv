If animal-derived products are to be consumed, it should overall be on a lesser scale and certainly without added hormones, cruelty, and filthiness of factory farms. For example, the average factory farmed chicken after hormones and antibiotics is fattened to multiple times what its natural weight would be. It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news. PSAs should be developed to lessen usage of animal products or to promote vegetarianism for health."
