If animal-derived products are to be consumed, it should overall be on a lesser scale and certainly without added hormones, cruelty, and filthiness of factory farms. For example, the average factory farmed chicken after hormones and antibiotics is fattened to multiple times what its natural weight would be. It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news. PSAs should be developed to lessen usage of animal products or to promote vegetarianism for health."
1,1,42.31 %,"insurance, pay, money, work, free, company, service, high, family, price","To be honest, 15% is probably the median when it comes to healthcare costs at the moment.  We pay about $200/month for our family's insurance and that is about the same percentage in how much my wife brings in/month.  If everyone has to pay a higher tax rate, I would be somewhat upset because then I would be paying more a month.  But if we really think about it, with the amount that we pay in taxes and insurance /month, if you have insurance or work, will most likely be the same amount.  For some cheaper (if you have a low paying job), and for some more expensive (if you have a high paying job or multiple incomes).  Yes we would be paying ""more,"" but the quality of health care would go up because they have their money/the funds to adequately treat and prevent and wouldn't have to worry about money."

Maintenance medications should be below $5.00 for a month supply Laws should be made to reduce the rate that medical providers are getting sued unless negligence is involved on the part of the medical provider. programs should be setup in order to educated the patient on how to effectively take their medications at home Programs should be setup in order to allow healthcare providers to followup with patient on regular basis to make sure that recurrence  of health problems are reduced. Pharmacist should not be allowed to work for very long hours in order to improve accuracy of pharmacist Very busy hospitals and retail pharmacist must employ adequate number of staff in order to avoid medical errors.
3,3,36.69 %,"people, health, care, afford, drug, medicine, issue, type, place, mental","I find it quite mind boggling to know that some people are selling generic brands of different medicines for example a type of medicine for cancer and shipping it to America being that, a women in china was labeled a fraud for smuggling drugs such as a drug for cancer and she has a lab in America and the medicine is made there and placed on shelves in the pharmacy's which is really sad so people really need to be careful with dealing with medicine now days getting the actual brand is more on the save side but as stated previously, you really have to pay careful attention now days because drugs that are smuggled in to America look like the exact pill quite scary but very informational to know the difference and be aware of the difference types of medicines to take for different reasons."
4,4,42.22 %,"healthcare, system, cost, government, education, provide, problem, good, person, medication","Now although I don't know as much about the healthcare system as I would like, I can say that I think the main idea for the healthcare system is to help those people who cannot help themselves. This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living."
