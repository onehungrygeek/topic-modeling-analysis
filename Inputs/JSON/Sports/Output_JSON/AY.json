			"Take a beach ball- one team has to keep the beach ball up in the air. the other team has to try to hit the balloon down to the ground. They will alternate every period of ten minutes for eight quarters. No time outs are given. Points are earned for every knock down giving each team four quarters to score on the other. 2 minutes are given in between periods. Fouls for pushing, shoving, hitting, and other unnecessary conduct or actions will be disciplined by either having the player sit out for a 3 minute period or ejected from the game. A tie will result in the election of two players from each team to compete in overtime for two 5 minute periods. The team with the most knockdowns after wins. Its a 5 vs 5 game. Eight man roster. Area size of play is 25x25."

If shooters were only given 5 seconds for each shot at a target it would affect them. The pressure would increase. Fast paced archery you would have to give each shooter 5 seconds max for each target. Count starts once the arrow is pulled back on the bow. Points will be labeled on targets to tally up score. Highest score wins. If a target is not hit a score of 0 will be given for that target. A tie breaker will result in a long distance shot."
