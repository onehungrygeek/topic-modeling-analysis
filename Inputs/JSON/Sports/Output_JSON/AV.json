			"There are 4 teams playing, each team has 5 members. Every team has a goal that they have to defend, and the objective is for the other team to shoot a ball into the basket. You can only score on a certain team 5 times within a period, if you manage to score more than 5 times, the point won't count. The basket is going to be about 5 feet high and there is going to be a goalie that is allow to deflect the ball but has to be 4 feet away from the goal. You are able to get a point if you shoot the ball into the goal. Style points will be included in people's shot so the fancy the shot is, the more points you get. A style shot counts as one shot but will give you a various amount of point. So lets say you've scored five times at the goal and they were all style shots worth 3 points each. You then have earned 15 points from that team and now have to move on to another basket. Now if the goalie deflects the ball and he isn't 4 feet away from the goal, the team loses a player for about 2 minutes. If a player also commits a foul, they will be out for one minute and if the player continues to foul, he earns another minute. Now the maximum amount of minutes a player can be out for is 5, once he commits his 6 foul the player is ejected from the game and the team loses the player permanently for the rest of the game. There will be three ten minute period and there will be a 5 minute over time if there is a tie within the teams. Each team is allowed 3 timeout throughout the whole game. Whenever you substitute players off the court, the game does not stop. If you do however have more than 5 players on the court, you'll be penalized with a player being out for a minute and a time out taken away from you. You're able to use any body part you want in this game whether it is you hands, feet, or head, everything is valid."
