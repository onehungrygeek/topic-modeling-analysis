			"The sport will be played on a court similar to a basketball court. Two teams will be competing against each other with 5 players on each team. When the game originally starts there will be 6 rubber bouncy balls lined evenly along half court. The objective of the game is to throw the balls at the other team like dodge ball to knock the other players out and use the same balls to throw in the net which are like the size of hockey nets on the ground. Each goal is a point. The game is played until the first team reaches 20 points. There is no time limit. The teams play two games against each other and if needed they play a third game for the tiebreaker. Once a player gets hit, he must step out of bounds for 1 minute before he may come back in. You may throw the ball anywhere at the other players. On the court there would be a half ring around the net. Players may only be in this ring for less than 3 seconds. For any fouls that occur a player from the team that caused the foul must sit out for 4 minutes."
