			"The sport is called The Zone in which it would consist of two teams of ten. The objective would be to eliminate the opposing team of its players. Each team would start with five balls on each side, to eliminate someone from the opposing team you would need to strike the body of the opposing player or catch a ball thrown at you, similar to dodge ball. However the difference is once a player is eliminated from the regular playing field they would move to the \"zone\" which is directly behind the opposing team. The purpose of this is to give that person a chance at getting back in the game, in order to do so players in the \"zone\" would need wait till a ball is thrown into the \"zone\" from the regular playing field once a zone player obtains a ball they need to strike the opposing team on a body part, but if their ball is caught they would be permanently  out of the game. If a player on the regular playing field is struck by someone on in the \"zone\" they are not consider out and can remain playing. The match is over once an entire team is removed from the regular playing field regardless of how many players are in the \"zone\". It would be a best 2 out of 3 format and only players who have not been eliminated from the \"zone\" move on to the next matches."

			"To make this idea work something similar to volleyball with changes would be good. Make the court bigger and add 2 more players to the 6 and each team has to have 4 guys and 4 girls on the court. Rather than hitting the ball players would have to catch it and throw it. For this to be more challenging a smaller ball with more mass would work best and have 2 balls instead of 1 ball in play . The ball hitting the ground to score points would remain the same. A net is not necessary a thick wire would be good and the ball must be thrown over the wire. Players can't be within five feet of the wire this is so they cant just jump and throw it straight down that would be to easy. Just like volleyball each ball can only be thrown 3 times, The third time has to be across the wire. When a ball is caught it can only be advanced by throwing it from the spot you caught it you only get one step which is to help throw. Serves can happen on both sides if both teams score a point and two serves can happen at once on the same side and the balls can be thrown simultaneously. First to 15 wins."
