The target knows what is going on and is specially trained in evading dangerous situations like, being \"captured\". Teams will need to be crafty, creative, diligent, intelligently, and physically capable of capturing their target. Close-quarter combat training would be needed to play this sport, but must be safely played. Must wear protective wear at all times and if your target falls to the ground then no more combat is allowed. If target falls to the ground they are basically incapable of making anymore moves and the capturing team would then call \"Win\" to notify everyone playing of the capture. However, if you happen to fall to the ground, then YOU are eliminated from the game and leave your team with however many are left."
