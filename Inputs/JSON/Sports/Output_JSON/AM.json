			"This should be mixed with paint ball. You could have teams that will have their own sector to watch over (these could be the different arenas) The teams will not find out which arena they get though until they show up. There could be a flag or some sort of \"prize\" that each team has to guard while simultaneously trying to capture the other teams. The teams will also not find out where there prize\/flag is hidden before the game. They will have to locate their flag\/prize before they can start looking for the other teams. Each team will have a certain color of paintball to go with their arena. The way to \"kill\" other opponents would be to shoot them. Once you have been shot you are out of the game. After the flag\/prize from another team has been captured, you have to make it back to your arena before you get shot. If you do not make it back to the arena with the flag before you are shot, the flag\/prize will stay where ever you were shot down. The team of the flag\/prize will then have to defend their flag\/prize from that spot no matter who's arena it is in. All the other teams will have to find the new spot where the flag was dropped as well. The flag can only be moved if an opposing team member moves it. The game is over once a team has gotten an opposing flag\/prize back to their arena.  also if every member of a team is \"killed\" before their flag is captured that flag in no longer in play. Teams will have to find a different flag. If they bring back the flag of a team that is out they get a penalty and cannot move from where they are for 5 minutes."
