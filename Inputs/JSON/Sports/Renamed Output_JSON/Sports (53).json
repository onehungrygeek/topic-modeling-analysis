The obsticle coarse will also have little hidden clue and riddles taped or written on the obsitcile coarse to lead you to the objects and what catagorie the belong in. In the coarse there will be rooms that are dark, bright, different atmospheres, colors types of floors to make it harder to find and go through.Also, there will be a different sports inside the obsticle coarse rooms that you have to play for a certain time or reach a certain goal that you are given when you enter. Such sports inside the rooms will be basketball, track and field events, tennis, soccer golf swimming and other stranious activties. At the very end of the obsticle coarse it times you to see how fast you went throough the whole maze and coarse, what extra pionts you earned for the sports and how many objects you attained."

			"I belive that you should add a mini obsticle course inside the water to make it harder to retrieve the objects such as hoops, doors, and tunnels. also mabye if there are certain colored objects that are worth more and could create a point system. if you get this certain target and get it through the hoop, it would be worth more or less than your opppenet and if, it was a close call this would be a way to know who was the real winner. it would be even better if it was timed and each match had a set time to finish. Also it would make it more fun to create each game to have a theme such as pertaining  to the holidays or season or events going on at the time. Such as hallowen, the objects could be small pumpkins. Or on the forth of july the objects could be red white and blue. And each color was worth different points. Also you could score them on thier dive i9nto the water and a buzzer could go off to began the game and if you dived well or did a specific trick that would add extra points. Also if you collected other objects that werent the main objects to grab, but they pertained to the certain themed and you captured them and put those in the hoop or just collected them and set them down when you came up for air. Also it could be more like a scavenger hunt under water with clues at the beggigng before you jumped in and the targets were harder to find, and you had to actully look for them in the obsticle course."

Also it could be team effort where they help each other receive points and witch two people ion each team can get up to the top the quickest with the most pionts. Also i beleive there should be some saftey precauntions, so you dont fall to your death. There should be a line, like a regular rock climbing with a balier person to keep you safe. and the floor should be padded also, even if there is a acceident. Or it could be like  cool slimy goo or a very soft pillow or ballon like landing to make it more funner when you do drop off and lose. or if you had a team of 2 or moer it could be like a tag team thing."
