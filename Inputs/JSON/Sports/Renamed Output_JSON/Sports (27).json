			"this is probably kind of dangerous, but it would be like a branch of horse races, but instead of horses there could be more non domesticated animals and like wild animals...maybe a hyena (I'm not sure actually they may be too wild), okay so like these have to be people who are trained professionals on how to train wild animals. they are able to be around tigers or jaguars with no problem, so instead of horse races it would be like jaguar races. BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE TRAINED FOR YEARS and train their animals for years and preferably have them grow up together so that way the animal is emotionally attached to its owner and won't have the urge to eat them. So they would start on a track, but instead of one of those rough tracks like the horses, this track would be made out of hardened mud for the comfort of the paws of the jaguars. If they aren't able to run on tracks (if it's impossible to train a jaguar to do that), maybe have the jaguars run to a certain target and have like a tracker on them while the rider is riding them. There could be five different bases with five racers and they all start in the middle and it will test the trainers as well as the jaguars. OR IT COULD BE JUST ONE BASE AND WHOEVER COULD FIND IT FIRST but that kind of sounds ridiculous. I don't know..."
