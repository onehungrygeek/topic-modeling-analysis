36	56a55	Daniel Gray	March 28, 2013, 11:47:58 AM	The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care.	-1	healthcare system changed features: healthcare cost reduced low income unemployed people family afford. obama care forced bring health care services ability pay hospital bill education system, doctors, specialists, practitioners deep educated good trained give service patient family part okay. order save time money, medical technology improve give health care service patients. example, robots doctors surgery, invented radiology scanner reduce radio way, uv ray, ultrasound wave, etc. equal health care services cost low canada, australia. insurance, obama care people obtain sick. affect health service, people option taking care health efficiency. moreover, education teach doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, people work healthcare patient health important else, taking insurance making fast diagnostic. aspect see, doctors, physician, specialists, nurses pay attention topic. medicine lowered price generic medication afford buy insurance not. people taking care health. lastly, maintaining good health make live don't healthcare services time sick people care.

People who is in the Nursing home would be suffered so many problems and can't get away from aging, so they need to have a good care even about mental, physical, and social health treatment to make them enjoy the rest of life. It should be more health care show or programs as many health issue commercials to everyone to make an announcement or warning about any thing related to health like overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, STDs, HIV thread, etc. There are now many and many case of rape related in the healthcare system, so it needs to pass a law or some restriction rules to reduce this issue as guaranteed the good working environment to all healthcare employees.	-1	thing, mention previous post, are: disable people, hiv/aids patients, etc. diseases, treated fairly normal people, weaker depress time life mental, physical, social health. lgbt community, treated equally people race, age, background, etc. task health care providers responsible providing quality health service. people nursing home suffered problems can't aging, good care mental, physical, social health treatment make enjoy rest life. health care show programs health issue commercials make announcement warning thing related health overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, stds, hiv thread, etc. case rape related healthcare system, pass law restriction rules reduce issue guaranteed good working environment healthcare employees.

I don't think it's a problem because people remain that way because they can't afford it. Yes, some people may choose not to learn more about it, but that's cause they might not feel the need to and that's why they feel less informed when asked about changes/improvements to the healthcare system. For example, young adults who are covered for healthcare by their parent's employers don't feel the need to learn about health care because they don't have to pay for it and it's not a concern for them.	10	agree education health care system improved. don't it's problem people remain can't afford it. yes, people choose learn it, that's feel that's feel informed asked changes/improvements healthcare system. example, young adults covered healthcare parent's employers don't feel learn health care don't pay it's concern them.

It's not like the more test they order the more they get paid. They get paid based on how much revenue they bring in. The price of a lot those tests and treatments is fairly high. So they don't bring in even half the cost of the treatment."	-1	" yes doctors ""money hungry"" remember kind compassion job. don't medical school hard, managed it. misconception doctors paid treatment... doesn't work way. it's test order paid. paid based revenue bring in. price lot tests treatments fairly high. don't bring half cost treatment."

Not to mention certain pharmaceuticals are the root of most illegal drugs being made in America today. Doctor's usually only get to see their patient once in situations where they diagnose, therefore they pass out prescriptions as a precautionary measure instead of actually reasoning if the patient truly needs the prescription. There needs to be discrete testing (i.e. personality tests or motor skills testing) that could be done in the waiting room or online before an appointment so the doctor can assess the results and have a better understanding of the patients true psychological, mental, or physical well-being before they're forced to diagnose the patient in one sitting.	5	adderol abuse colleges problem. mention pharmaceuticals root illegal drugs made america today. doctor's patient situations diagnose, pass prescriptions precautionary measure reasoning patient prescription. discrete testing (i.e. personality tests motor skills testing) waiting room online appointment doctor assess results understanding patients true psychological, mental, physical well-being they're forced diagnose patient sitting.

I'm usually not a person for government stepping into a business' business, but when that one company can charge ridiculous prices just because they're the only seller, there is a problem.	18	person rare, severe problem, local wal-marts, cvs pharmacy, walgreen's stores provide inexpensive generic medicines (both shelf counter) insurance needed. biggest issue medicine, big companies patent medicine it's quality cure health problem. i'm person government stepping business' business, company charge ridiculous prices they're seller, problem.

The main concern shouldn't be making every single person in American pay for every service that most will not use just so that a few can take advantage of it. The main concern should focus on helping the lower class who needs the services, obtain the standard of living that can provide them. Instead of throwing billions of tax dollars into food stamps and welfare checks, focus that money into creating the mass amounts of jobs that encourage the poor to get back on their feet, rather than giving to them handouts that encourage laying down.	-1	health care system forcing people businesses well. main concern shouldn't making single person american pay service advantage it. main concern focus helping lower class services, obtain standard living provide them. throwing billions tax dollars food stamps welfare checks, focus money creating mass amounts jobs encourage poor back feet, giving handouts encourage laying down.

34	64c35	Tiffany Terry	March 29, 2013, 02:55:57 PM	"The health care system was built around helping your neighbor in a sense. In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education. Education would help reduce the work load through people going to where they are suppose to go for a given emergency, not to mention them themselves eating healthier, treating themselves better, etc..."	-1	"health care system built helping neighbor sense. group ten people, person 9 people pay safety net will. major problems system doesn't account population boom, i.e. ""baby-boomers"". ways band aid situation make temporary fix increasing restrictions. restrict health care though, give quality care it. lot possibilities ""band-aid"" situation. however, major fix system details cost expenditures healthcare system it's sub-section. current place exhausting resources restricting health care system this. long term fix preventative care i.e. technology education. restrict current health care system awhile, easy fix. make grants study colleges firms research diseases, recovery rate, etc... give incentive invent techniques pre-screen patients ailments categories patients system reduce emergency room wait time. spread load system places traffic go. costly upkeep cost time build, long term effect clinics serve minor emergencies life threatening emergencies. problem people different. robbed call 911, hear shots fired call 911, lose wallet call 911? thus, education. education reduce work load people suppose emergency, mention eating healthier, treating better, etc..."

Like taxes, the government takes out a percentage based on what the person makes, the cost of health care should be the same way. Because everyone makes different amounts of income the cost of health care should cost accordingly. 	-1	health care affordable. cost living cost staying alive shouldn't well. taxes, government takes percentage based person makes, cost health care way. makes amounts income cost health care cost accordingly.

Most doctors will suggest lipo-suction, body wraps, or weight loss pills. But has a doctor ever prescribed a healthy meal plan, or a work out schedule? Of course not! America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it. What a caring doctor should prescribe is a dose of ""lay off on the McDonalds"", work out regularly and choose to be healthy. A healthy mindset can also build the confidence of a person for a lifetime and is the fuel for motivation."	-1	"overweight loose weight doctor doctor solution. doctors suggest lipo-suction, body wraps, weight loss pills. doctor prescribed healthy meal plan, work schedule? not! america business, americans money. seldom doctors care patients making profit them. lipo-suction, body wraps weight loss pills expensive, healthcare cover it, end paying confidence working it. caring doctor prescribe dose ""lay mcdonalds"", work regularly choose healthy. healthy mindset build confidence person lifetime fuel motivation."

She is also an older woman so it will also take more time to heal. Her family does not have that kind of money and her insurance does not cover the costs of the surgery. I think this is sad America, $5000 seems like a reasonable amount but the fact that insurance does not cover the cost of this surgery makes me sick to my stomach.

46	46k81	William Diaz	April 04, 2013, 01:40:03 PM	It is common knowledge that corporate employees of a business make literally hundreds of times more than scantily paid lower-level employees. With that in mind, what if there were a maximum wage employed to go alongside the minimum wage? With a more equally distributed propagation of profits, more people could afford more. Why struggle more than we have to? The monster that stands in the way is greed. Anyway... Ideally, CEOs would still make enough of their share to afford their extra cake/comfortability while entry-level employees would actually be able to afford the health care the companies boast about offering. If there were some type of ratio that limited how much a business owner could make versus a cashier, I'd be for it. Example: At a time, Ben and Jerry's ice cream company had a 7 to 1 ratio. (The numbers off the top of my head might not be exact, but it is the point that matters.) At any time, the owners could only make seven times more than the lower workers. That certainly beats other more common CEOS that make 578 times more than their wage slaves who sweat for $7.25 today.	-1	common knowledge corporate employees business make literally hundreds times scantily paid lower-level employees. mind, maximum wage employed alongside minimum wage? equally distributed propagation profits, people afford more. struggle to? monster stands greed. anyway... ideally, ceos make share afford extra cake/comfortability entry-level employees afford health care companies boast offering. type ratio limited business owner make versus cashier, i'd it. example: time, ben jerry's ice cream company 7 1 ratio.

If animal-derived products are to be consumed, it should overall be on a lesser scale and certainly without added hormones, cruelty, and filthiness of factory farms. For example, the average factory farmed chicken after hormones and antibiotics is fattened to multiple times what its natural weight would be. It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news. PSAs should be developed to lessen usage of animal products or to promote vegetarianism for health.	-1	factory farms outlawed. animal-derived products consumed, lesser scale added hormones, cruelty, filthiness factory farms. example, average factory farmed chicken hormones antibiotics fattened multiple times natural weight be. eventually forced grow large legs longer support body. studies shown consumption chickens detrimentally affected physical development pubescent girls, causing start menstrual cycles early 8 years addition, develop breasts early. least, factory farms outlawed, undercover investigations broadcasted news. psas developed lessen usage animal products promote vegetarianism health.

All of those nations have healthcare, and sterling economies. Treatment for certain conditions like cancer, for example, are difficult to overcome even with large paychecks. The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. No one in the 21st century, living in the world's most affluent nation, should be denied access to healthcare. Tax rates may increase slightly, but it will be for the overall betterment of society.	-1	universal healthcare program effect canada, western european nations uk, germany, france, australia, greater good. nations healthcare, sterling economies. treatment conditions cancer, example, difficult overcome large paychecks. manner banks monitor credit means people forced choose ignoring treatment, ruining credit history, make taking loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. 21st century, living world's affluent nation, denied access healthcare. tax rates increase slightly, betterment society.

For example, doctors can be made eligible for lower interest rates when taking out mortgages or perhaps their children can be provided with reduced fiscal costs. The idea is that reduced expenses will negate their somewhat reduced earnings which would occur from lowered healthcare bills.	-1	subsidizing companies far. doctor's reluctant reduce earnings. problem circumvented government laws assist doctors ways. example, doctors made eligible lower interest rates taking mortgages children provided reduced fiscal costs. idea reduced expenses negate reduced earnings occur lowered healthcare bills.

By supporting education, specially in healthcare profession, we can produce more doctors, nurses, and others related healthcare career. The term of supporting education I mean is, for example provide more scholarships for students, provide more opportunity and more campaign to level up the interested of student in Healthcare profession careers. Also, provide more opportunity to international student so they will be able to work in the US, provide more funds and affordable education to low-income student. Tuition needs to be flat rate, rather than keep going up every year. No one would be able to continue their education in a higher level of education if they know they will be broke after graduating.	-1	education fundamental root country. supporting education, specially healthcare profession, produce doctors, nurses, related healthcare career. term supporting education is, provide scholarships students, provide opportunity campaign level interested student healthcare profession careers. also, provide opportunity international student work us, provide funds affordable education low-income student. tuition flat rate, year. continue education higher level education broke graduating.

Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail.

I know that's mean but why are we wasting hundreds of thousand of dollars and man hours tending to someone who is going to pass anyway? Because the family has that choice i know. But change it. Allow a max of 12 months on life support.. after that the family has 2 options, pay for it out of pocket (no more insurance) or pull the plug. As of now if long term care or intense care costs to much insurance already says they will only pay for a lesser quality of care, the logical next step is to just terminate that care.	-1	save money? pull plug life support. that's wasting hundreds thousand dollars man hours tending pass anyway? family choice know. change it. max 12 months life support.. family 2 options, pay pocket (no insurance) pull plug. long term care intense care costs insurance pay lesser quality care, logical step terminate care.

Free sounds great, but if humans can not wait for 3 hours in the Doc's office can you imagine waiting 5 months to be seen? Our health care is slow with burnout staff, and out dated equipment.

23	17x14	Kevin Campbell	March 04, 2013, 01:38:22 PM	Educating the masses in a variety of areas of health care, especially the ones who are prone to make injunctions of their own health as well as potentially harming others around them, could save a lot of money. Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.	-1	educating masses variety areas health care, prone make injunctions health potentially harming them, save lot money. unaware dangers drugs teenage pregnancies cost money unable pay hospital expenses. educating individuals crap i've experienced school stop people realize effects actions society. people life support family pay riches alive. decisions made technology save people. care elderly people, mentally unstable, persons severe mental in-capabilities paid government insurance companies people cared for, cases aren't any. disabled, physically otherwise, unable unwilling contribute society shape form hinder progress reform literally fiscally taking space advance technology save people illness put order utilize resources effectively. doctors psychiatrists apt hand prescriptions drugs, mental disorders depression. creates problems patients hospitalized obtaining, buying patient stealing them, drugs manners intended for. treatment drugs resort means patients office. possibly subsidizing costs hospital expenses lower costs hospitals pay, lower insurance costs out-of-pocket expenses patients. people responsible, taught be, health care costs. uninsured person emergency room, time make person health insurance, rest society pay literally hospitals cut back staff, technology quality medicine procedures. explore possibilities advanced technology potentially cut back spending removing invasive costly surgeries therapy.

However, most people with low incomes aren't able to afford all of the necessary things it takes to stay healthy like buying Organic foods, gym memberships, and supplements, etc. So these people are forced to either pay a higher insurance rate or have none at all. I do agree that there should be an incentive to leading a healthy lifestyle and maybe if gym memberships or ""healthy food"" discounts were offered through our employers or insurance companies it would help aid to a healthier lifestyle where healthcare wasn't such a burden."	11	"insurance companies require full physical carry pass fail; pass good health affordable rate. however, people low incomes aren't afford things takes stay healthy buying organic foods, gym memberships, supplements, etc. people forced pay higher insurance rate all. agree incentive leading healthy lifestyle gym memberships ""healthy food"" discounts offered employers insurance companies aid healthier lifestyle healthcare wasn't burden."

They immediately wanted to put me on the most expensive medication they could find ( which had a whole laundry list of side affects itself).

80	92y54	Tammy Fischer	April 25, 2013, 12:44:06 PM	Affordability, quality and accessibility are some of the characteristics of a good healthcare system. Quality;          Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.  I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have.    	-1	affordability, quality accessibility characteristics good healthcare system. quality;          quality important property healthcare system. order practice great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  trained. training include educational learning medical schools ability operate kinds tools, soft wares, equipments needed carryout respective roles. training include social skills interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills critical thinking skills. also, order provide healthcare, healthcare facilities equipped, easily accessible, date terms modernization. accessibility;      apart quality healthcare system, patients accessible quality care afford not. don't thing wards someone's life; matter race, religion ethnicity. personally wrong turn afford pay. sad lot people refused prescription pharmacy pay time blame people pharmacy business.  problem systematic angle component contribute healthcare problems have.

Yet, you can always challenge the government when it does something wrong, its called supreme court cases. Second, it is inhumane to not give somebody healthcare because they are not a citizen of the US. Third it is the private companies that set the the price, the private sector is only concerned with profit, which in turn means worst financial strain on the care receiver.	68	how  private sector better. people receiving care, hold private sector accountable. yet, challenge government wrong, called supreme court cases. second, inhumane give healthcare citizen us. private companies set price, private sector concerned profit, turn means worst financial strain care receiver.

After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someone  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more.
