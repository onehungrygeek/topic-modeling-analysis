			"The sport will involve using a stick to get across the field while the opposing team throws wiffle balls at you.  The first team to have all members make it across first with the team flag wins.  Each player from one team takes a turn running through the field and using the stick to deflect the balls.  One member will have a concealable flag that will have to be posted up once it's made to the other side of the field.  If you are hit by the ball then you must drop and stay there while the the other team members try to make it across.  You can also have the choice of running in a formation with the whole team for an automatic win if all make it across safely.  The opposing team members (ones throwing the ball) only get one throw each when a single opposing team member is running through the field.  The throwing team members each get an additional two throws each when the opposing team chooses to use a team formation."

I think it'd be a cool sport if we combined the two, making it like a capture the flag game with water\/paint guns. It could be played on a football field that has been turned into a maze-like scenario that has various ways to get to both sides, to encourage teams to run into each other. The teams begin on opposite sides of the football field. The flags are in the middle of the football field. You know you're getting closer to the center because the yard lines will still be available. In order to complete the capture the flag you have to get the flag to the opposite side of the field that you started on. You have the option of not getting your flag but getting everyone on your team to the other side unscathed in under five minutes in order to automatically win the game. Otherwise, you must capture the flag and have at least one unpainted person get to the other side of the field before someone from the other team does the same."
