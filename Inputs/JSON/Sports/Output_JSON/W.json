Sprint to the ball with your next club and hit the ball as far as you can towards the hole.  The rules are the same as golf but you have to run to each ball. The goal of the game is to finish 18 holes as fast as you can and hit the golf ball into Hole 1- 18 as low as possible. The winner of the game puts the ball in the golf least amount as possible and finishes the 18 hole golf course as fast as possible.  This game can be played both as in individual or as a team sport."

In order to score, at least one member of the team must be carrying the \"colored dodgeball\" across the goal line without having been eliminated. Once a team member crosses the goal line, the team is awarded points and the ball is given to the opposing team for a chance to score. The game is time restricted and the winner being decided by who scored the most points during the given period of time."

The opposing team will be able to strategically place themselves anywhere on their half of their field (Between their own goal line and 50 yard line.) Ten of the 14 playing dodgeballs will be divided between the two teams at the start of the possession, while the other 4 will be lined up on the 50 yard goal line, free for anyone to grab at any point of the game. The objective of the team with the colored dodgeball is to cross the opponents goal line. The \"carrier\", (the person who is carrying the ball) can not place the ball on the floor, but he\/she can pass it to another team mate. If the ball hits the floor, it is a change a possession and it must be thrown or kicked to the opposing team. Once the opposing team receives the ball, play continues. Players are eliminated when they are struck out with a hit from a dodgeball. If a member catches an opponents ball, a team mate may enter play once again."

Also I think to elaborate on it being a team sport. It can be like a relay. One person can attempt to do X amount of holes and then the next person will have a turn.

			"Running could also be replaced with speedy golf carts. Prior to the game, teams can customize and upgrade their carts to gain better performance such as speed and maneuvering. To make things more interesting, all the players could begin at a starting line and would race to any of the 18 holes. The players could be knowledgeable of the playing field before the game as well, knowing which holes are the harder to hit, which are the easiest, and which holes are the quickest to get to. If a player reaches a hole, the hole is closed to all players until the player who got to the hole first is done. This would add extra strategical factors for the players: Players could potentially have a pre-game planned route to each hole. If a hole is already taken, players would also be faced with a decision to wait for the hole to open up or they could race to another hole to prevent wasting time."
