This could be resolved if the healthcare system were subsidized by the government. I believe that the government could do well do channel more funds towards the healthcare system. The funds do not need to be generated via tax hikes; they can be allocated by reducing spending in other aspects such as the military.",

All of those nations have healthcare, and sterling economies. Treatment for certain conditions like cancer, for example, are difficult to overcome even with large paychecks. The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. No one in the 21st century, living in the world's most affluent nation, should be denied access to healthcare. Tax rates may increase slightly, but it will be for the overall betterment of society.",

This problem can be circumvented if the government comes up with new laws to assist doctors in other ways. For example, doctors can be made eligible for lower interest rates when taking out mortgages or perhaps their children can be provided with reduced fiscal costs. The idea is that reduced expenses will negate their somewhat reduced earnings which would occur from lowered healthcare bills.",

Also, provide more opportunity to international student so they will be able to work in the US, provide more funds and affordable education to low-income student.

Sweden, if you are a born citizen, you get to go to college for free. this is how it should be here in America. with a smarter population, health care would take care of itself. people would be able to afford their own health care. also we might become a top country once again. i still think their needs to be competition into what college a person attends though, otherwise college would be like high school, just a right of passage.",

However, to ensure that everybody has access to healthcare is costly and therefore requires funds, hence making sure that everybody has insurance.
