I think of this game as a modern day \"freeze tag\" with the addition of adding cups to be taken away while playing. To add a twist to the game, the \"royal cups\" could be placed around a in a circle or square, and when an opponent got hit, they would be sent to \"jail\" on the opposite side and a player from their team would have to throw a ball to get them out and rejoin their team on the other side.
