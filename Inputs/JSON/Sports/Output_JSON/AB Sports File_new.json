There isn't much I can add to this idea seeing as its already mostly developed, but in terms of playing quality we'll probably have to think up situations to where added rulings are needed.  For instance; to what extent can the goalie move within the endzone, and would there be penalties for the goalie missing the ball in the endzone?  These are just things that we would need to develop as we move along with such an endeavour.",
