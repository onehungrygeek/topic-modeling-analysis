They then have to stop and either shoot it from where they are or pass the ball. this is kind of stupid but I'm trying (this is a really hard thing to do). okay so when the point guard or whoever rebounded the ball in, passes the ball that offender only can make 4 movements. They then can choose to shoot.. or pass but this is their last pass. so kind of like freeze tag basketball ... or like maybe they can have like a buzzer sound so scratch what I said and like they can move however much they want (but they can't pass the ball) until a buzzer (it has to be randomized to eliminate bias)"
