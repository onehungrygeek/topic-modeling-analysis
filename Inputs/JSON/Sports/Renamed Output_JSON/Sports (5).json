You would play on a field indoor or outdoor and the rules would basically be like a combination of both soccer and hockey. You can kick the ball with your feet, but in order to make a goal you would have to use the stick. There would be about 7-9-ish players on the field at once. It could be called Socckey or Hocker. Actually those both sound disgusting so probably neither of those names."

			"This sport could be played in either singles or doubles, but no more than two per team. The object of the sport is that each team (either on your own or with a partner) has to dive down to the bottom of a pool (probably pretty deep) and collect objects previously specified. You would have three chances per person to find each specified objects before your time runs out and it is the next team member's chance. If each player on a team strikes out three times, then the next team takes their turn and has to find their specified objects. The idea is to boost memory in a high stress situation and to be in tip-top shape in order to hold your breath as long as you can."

Maybe the more people you have, you could have two or three people on a team working together in order to find everything. The list would increase though..."

I think players or teams should each get the same but separate opportunity to find and retrieve the same objects in the same locations.
