2473,0,"C.T.T. (Capture the Target): Like many sports, this will be a Team Sport. Teams will consist of 5 people. This sport will be ""Secret-Agent"" based. Two teams compete to see who can capture the ""Target"" (which would be a random person) first. The target knows what is going on and is specially trained in evading dangerous situations like, being ""captured"". Teams will need to be crafty, creative, diligent, intelligently, and physically capable of capturing their target. Close-quarter combat training would be needed to play this sport, but must be safely played. Must wear protective wear at all times and if your target falls to the ground then no more combat is allowed. If target falls to the ground they are basically incapable of making anymore moves and the capturing team would then call ""Win"" to notify everyone playing of the capture. However, if you happen to fall to the ground, then YOU are eliminated from the game and leave your team with however many are left.","point, must, field, flag, end, oppose, target, place, different, new"

If a player's sash is torn off, the player must throw the ball straight in the air for a free for all take, and the play has to put his sash back on right after to continue in the game.

The purpose of the game will be to get the ball through a circular goal at a certain dimensional height in the sky.

2843,5,"Erase Ball: Basically similar to dodge ball where there is a couple of balls placed in the middle of the court with two teams of at least 5 on each side. The objective of the game is to get all the members of the other team out by hitting them with one of the erase balls. However the difference in this game from dodge ball is that if the erase ball makes contact with your body, whichever body part it was will be erased, meaning you no longer can use it. An example would be that if you got hit in your left leg, you would not be able to use it anymore and would have to stand only on your right leg since your left leg was ""erased"". If you got hit in the torso or stomach however, everything from the place you got hit down would be ""erased"". The only way to be able to get back your lost body parts is if you catch a ball. One body part can be replaced back per catch. If you missed the catch however you will lose whatever hand or arm or whatever the part of the body the ball made contact with. Time limit for games is usually ten minutes or Unlimited if you are playing ""fight to the death"" style. The court will be around 20 ft long and each team will stand 10ft away from where the balls are in the middle prior to whistle being blown to start the game. In the ten minute games, crossing the line prior to the 5 min mark result in an automatic erase which means the player is out. However, at the 5 min mark, players may move over 5 ft from the middle to other team territory to gain an advantage. At the 1 min mark, free reign of the whole court is viable and there are no boundaries. Wins can be determined by the number of players completely erased and by the number of body part that are left on a persons body. Major body parts will be counted only. So the head, two hands, two forearms, two shoulders, two thighs, two shins, and two feet. If there is a tie, then team captains will square off on a one on one battle. Some special rules that should also be known is that no teammate can be returned even if you catch a ball and still have all your body parts, unless it is a shot to the to head. Head shot is an automatic kill.","team, game, get, sport, person, make, time, member, win, go"

However, if we randomly give out rewards such as being able to use their dominant side for a round or for a certain play, this will spice things up and add to the competitiveness. What would also be interesting, would be if every single team member does not know one another personally at all. Within each of these teams, there will be a snake; this team members job is to purposely mess up the team they are on so the other team wins. If the other team wins, they will win a cash prize. Members of each team will know there is a snake in their team; however they will not know who it is.

2681,5,"Something that would be awesome for this sport would be obstacles they are having to face as a team and overcome as a team as well, such as bicycling in a storm, up a very steep hill, one of their tires randomly giving out. Of course, this sport measures their athletic qualities by making sure they are in sync and meeting their goal at a certain time, but giving them obstacles to overcome such as these will test their mental aptitude for challenges as well as how well they work in teams. A team might be the most physically fit but hate one another, which will cause them to not work well as a team and lose. In contrast, another team might not be the most fit, however their level of communication is impeccable and they end up winning.","team, game, get, sport, person, make, time, member, win, go"
2680,5,"What type of ball would be used for this sport? I think the best type of ball would be something between a soccer and volleyball. Must be sturdy enough to deal with the kicks, but soft enough to not hurt the arms. The goal would be something between a goal and the members of the other team not being able to reach the ball in time. The referee must use his judgement to determine this. Also, physical contact between members of opposing teams should be allowed, I'm not talking about straight up punching someone for the ball, but distracting someone, taking the ball away from them, slightly bumping into them, should all be okay and not considered fouls. This will make the members of the teams think of strategies and will make every team different from one another because while one of the teams may be very physical in order to score, other teams may be very precise in their thinking and clean in order to score. This will make for the good vs evil concept that most fans have towards different teams, always thinking that their team is the best one, even when they lose miserably.","team, game, get, sport, person, make, time, member, win, go"

So it can't be, you reach 20, use the dart, then the other team uses the dart on you and then your team goes back to 20 so you get another one. But you don't have to use the dart once you get it, you may keep it for later on, but only the person who reached the 20 mark may use it. Maybe at 35 you get an air pump which you may use for the rest of the round so one person could be pumping air into balloons while the rest continue to gather balloons. There could also be some balloon animals that are more points than regular balloons. And maybe even balloons of different color have different points. Like red, blue, orange, and green are 1 point, purple, white, and black are 2, and yellow/gold be 3.

The objective is for a team to throw a boomerang, or some other projectile, through the rings in order to earn points for their team.  Depending on how challenging it is to throw through the ring determines the amount of points a team will receive.  The players must get to their opponent's side of the field by passing the boomerang from one player on a team to another.  This is where it could get a little challenging due to the curved trajectory of the boomerang.  If an opposing player intercepts a pass, he may begin to run to the other side of the field.  Once a team does score, the opposing team starts off with the boomerang and can run to the other side of the field.  The game will be divided into two separate halves.

When it comes to both players running to second no one is safe; even though they are on the base they can still get tagged because rule is two people cant be on the same base at one time.

The two competitors will be placed in a boxing ring armed only with a pair of boxing gloves and will be instructed to fight until one of the competitors surrenders, or until 30 minutes (or however many minutes the players agree upon before starting) passes. If the time is up before anyone surrenders then it part one is considered a tie. If someone surrenders before the time passes then the victor is awarded one point. After part one they both move on to part two, which is a sprint. The sprint can either be won by running a certain amount of distance before your opponent, or by seeing who is able to run the farthest in a 30 minute period. The method of winning will be decided by the players before the sprint begins. The victor will receive one point. In case of a tie, neither party will receive points. The final part will take place after a small ten minute rest. Part three will test the ability of the atheletes to complete a puzzle before their competitor. The victor will be the person that finishes their puzzle first, thus providing very little possibility for a tie. The winner is awarded one point.

For this to be more challenging a smaller ball with more mass would work best and have 2 balls instead of 1 ball in play . The ball hitting the ground to score points would remain the same. A net is not necessary a thick wire would be good and the ball must be thrown over the wire. Players can't be within five feet of the wire this is so they cant just jump and throw it straight down that would be to easy. Just like volleyball each ball can only be thrown 3 times, The third time has to be across the wire.

Doing low hits that barely make it off the ground would be considered cheap shots and score a point to the other side.

The people in the pool do not have the opportunity to score unless they are outside the pool and on the field. In order to get out of the pool and be able to score points for yourself, the dodge balls that are in the pool as a result of the offensive player's objective to score will be used by the pool players to try to tag the outside offensive players(as they try to score). So if the offensive player gets tagged by a dodge ball by a pool player, they essentially trade places and then the pool player gets out of the pool and has the opportunity to score (again, the scoring objective is in the pool somewhere).  Essentially, the offensive field players need proximity to the pool in order to score and the pool players utilize this proximity to tag that player out to get an opportunity to score for themselves. In the aspect of fairness, there should be equal opportunity for each (pool players and field players) to score.
