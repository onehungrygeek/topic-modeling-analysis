        "content": "Now although I don't know as much about the healthcare system as I would like, I can say that I think the main idea for the healthcare system is to help those people who cannot help themselves. This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living.",

It would be interesting to see how much of an affect a \"Healthcare Truck\" would have on a society. Like if a truck were to drive around almost like an ice cream truck and offer information on healthcare to all Americans. On this truck you could also apply for healthcare and talk to representatives that can provide help to those who don't know what their doing or could be doing to make their situation better. you could maybe find a way to teach kids about healthcare in school so that they can be prepared for their future responsibilities. Healthcare giveaways over the radio or drawings (like the lottery). You can have people turn in empty medicine bottles for tickets to enter in a drawing and the winner would receive Healthcare rewards.",

While the Nurse that is in over their head in education debt is getting paid garbage to put up with American's rudeness in the hospital. The very first thing we need to look at is, if we want good care, we need to take care of those providing us. Somehow more money needs to find its way to these hard working people if not money some kind of compensation for working those ridiculous hours and working as hard as they do. Having over tired burnout healthcare personal is unacceptable. If the Obama admin wants to dabble in health care, then lets pull some Gov money to the system, no reason why a car company should get billions when a hospital doesn't even get gas money for ER runs.",

But you also are covered in more areas. With that said, if you pay more for health care that covers more, your meds will be covered. If you cant afford it, then oh well, go try harder. Americans complain and complain they had a 100 dollar co-pay. Why are you complaining, the meds cost a heck of a lot more to research, develop, get a approved... hell im not going to explain the business process here, you get it. In short, if you cant afford 100 dollars, then maybe you should look down at your feet and regret paying 98$ for those nikes you are wearing",

And this will never change for the private sector has no power on this, the only hope is Government steps. Going back to cars, there is no reason a GMC should have more technology in the dash board then the office i sit in to get my back checked out. I have no idea on how to get better technology but it is needed. It is a cost well spent, why have 3 different tests when 1 machine can answer everything.. oh thats right, so the insurance companies can make money.. so maybe that is were the Gov should step in... stop letting them rob us blind.",

        "content": "Educating the masses in a variety of areas of health care, especially the ones who are prone to make injunctions of their own health as well as potentially harming others around them, could save a lot of money. Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.",

However, most people with low incomes aren't able to afford all of the necessary things it takes to stay healthy like buying Organic foods, gym memberships, and supplements, etc. So these people are forced to either pay a higher insurance rate or have none at all. I do agree that there should be an incentive to leading a healthy lifestyle and maybe if gym memberships or \"healthy food\" discounts were offered through our employers or insurance companies it would help aid to a healthier lifestyle where healthcare wasn't such a burden.",
