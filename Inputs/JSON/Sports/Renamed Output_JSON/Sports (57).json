The circle then must continue to the left\/right with the next person doing just as the first did, but the objective is no matter what movement you do, make sure your hands are not touched, because that causes elimination from the game. Players may bend, twist, get on the floor, do whatever it takes to keep their hands from getting touched. Of the last two standing the winner will be the Champion\/Master and the beginning of the new game, participants bow down to them"

If hit, they are out, if not, then the game will continue. Last person standing is the winner."
