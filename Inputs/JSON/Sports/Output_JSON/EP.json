			"Played in a swimming pool, this sport is similar to basketball.  It requires a ball about the size and of same material as a volleyball.  With four goals on each side of a square pool, four teams will have to swim to the center to gain control of the ball and throw it into the opponent's goal.  The winning team is the team who successfully scores once into each of the other team's goals.  You must pass the ball in order to move it around the pool.  When you have possession of the ball, you will not be allowed to move (similar to ultimate frisby).  You only have the option to shoot or pass the ball when it is in your possession.  This could be considered a contact sport similar to a soccer game."

It is played by throwing the tennis ball at the the wall.  If you are hit with the ball after it bounces off of the wall, you must run and touch the wall before another player picks up the ball and throws it at the wall.  If you do not make it, you are out for the remainder of that round.  However if a player catches a ball that bounced off of the wall before it hits the ground, the player who threw the ball is out."
