The game would last from 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the endurance level of the players. The person guarding the goal would have to be on a unicycle instead of a tricycle and could only use a cannoe paddle to hit the ball away from the goal."

Players can get a spoon, if they collect four of the same cards, and if players see that another player has gotten 4 of the same kind, they are allowed to try to get a spoon. If there are 5 players, then there are 4 spoons, 4 players 3 spoons, etc. if a player does not get a spoon, then they are out of the game. the twist, players must go through an obstacle course to get to a spoon. Climbing a wall, then crawling through a tunnel, etc. to get to a spoon. When all available spoons are taken, the next round begins, continuing until there is one single player and winner."

			"It would be awesome if the people wore some sort of vest that would glow once it got hit so you know you have been hit, or it would glow when the other person caught your ball because if it's dark you may not see them catch the ball. Also to glow when you're out of balls so you don't try to cheat and keep playing, but maybe when you're down to one ball you are allowed to steal someones ball unless they only have one left as well and if you steal theirs, then get yours and you're out. And maybe even a belt to put your balls on so your hands are free to catch a ball. I like this idea and maybe it doesn't have to be played in just a wooded area but any place that has obstacles of sorts for hiding and what not."

			"I think it would be cool if once you reached a certain amount of balloons you get special perks. Like after your team has reached a total of 20 balloons, you get one dart to throw at the other persons bin, in an attempt to make them lose balloons, but you only get the dart once when you reach 20. So it can't be, you reach 20, use the dart, then the other team uses the dart on you and then your team goes back to 20 so you get another one. But you don't have to use the dart once you get it, you may keep it for later on, but only the person who reached the 20 mark may use it. Maybe at 35 you get an air pump which you may use for the rest of the round so one person could be pumping air into balloons while the rest continue to gather balloons. There could also be some balloon animals that are more points than regular balloons. And maybe even balloons of different color have different points. Like red, blue, orange, and green are 1 point, purple, white, and black are 2, and yellow\/gold be 3. Then the color of balloon animal would be double the normal balloon point, so a red animal would be 2, while a purple animal would be 4."

			"The surroundings for normal table tennis is usually open but in this one there would be pillars placed on both sides so you can bounce it off of them and the ball may bounce multiple times on your side, but you're only allowed to hit it once so you may wait for the ball to be at a certain spot before you hit it back. There would also be a border as to where the ball would still be considered in play so power shots will still have effect in the game. You may also use any part of your body to hit the ball back as long as it only hits your paddle once. So you may use your chest to stop the ball then hit it back with the paddle or even hit the ball back with your hand if you so choose. Having the ball be able to bounce multiple times on your side would be better because then it adds to the extremeness of it than regular table tennis."

Also if they get five people out in a row without getting out then they could have an extra life. These perks would carry on to the next game."

			"The enclosure will be the size of a soccer field. There will be lots of obstacles to surpass to get balloons, there will be tunnels that balloons are hidden inside of, there will be ropes with balloons at the top that must be climbed. All of the balloons will be spread all around the field, and each of the four teams will be scrambling to collect as many as possible and bringing them back to the bin before time is up.",
			"Each of the three rounds rounds is 4 minutes long.",

			"After each round is over, a referee will spread out all of the balloons so as to keep one group from stockpiling there balloons in one spot for easy access.",

			"Players must wear over large shirts.",
