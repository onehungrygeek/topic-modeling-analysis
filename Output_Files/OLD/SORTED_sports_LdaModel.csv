It could a be an intense form of tag, or like in Harry Potter, a kind of ball game. What would be be entertaining however would be a game that involves a race through the air, through hoops around a cray track. It could be a team effort where a two teams of five players try to out smart each other to win the race as they fly. One player could be the person who vies for speed and agility, trying to get ahead. Two others could be a sort of defense, protecting the other players from getting knocked off the course and the last two would help offense, propelling the lead players toward victory across the finish line. I think it would be quite intense to watch, especially with the added bonus of players being pushed off the track and having to catch up.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

If the time is up before anyone surrenders then it part one is considered a tie. If someone surrenders before the time passes then the victor is awarded one point.

The sprint can either be won by running a certain amount of distance before your opponent, or by seeing who is able to run the farthest in a 30 minute period. The method of winning will be decided by the players before the sprint begins. The victor will receive one point. In case of a tie, neither party will receive points.

The objective is for a team to throw a boomerang, or some other projectile, through the rings in order to earn points for their team.  Depending on how challenging it is to throw through the ring determines the amount of points a team will receive.  The players must get to their opponent's side of the field by passing the boomerang from one player on a team to another.  This is where it could get a little challenging due to the curved trajectory of the boomerang.  If an opposing player intercepts a pass, he may begin to run to the other side of the field.  Once a team does score, the opposing team starts off with the boomerang and can run to the other side of the field.  The game will be divided into two separate halves.

Just like in Baseball, the defensive team is in the outfield, on the bases, the mound, and behind home plate. The offensive team has on member of the team come up to home plate, he has a choice to either kick the ball or hit it with a flat bat, however the player has no idea what the pitcher is wanting the through it could be hittable or kickable. instead of running to the right like in Baseball, the player will run to the right (clockwise), the defensive team has to either catch the ball before it hits the ground, tag 1st base, or tag the runner. there are 3 outs, and 10 innings. When the offensive player is at Home base, he/she has 3 outs, and 4 balls. if you get 4 balls, you get to safely go to 1st base, however if you get 3 outs, well, you're out. To score, just like in baseball, and kickball you have to circle the bases, tagging each one to move to the next base, then to Home base, that would be considered one point, per runner to home.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

2791,5,"Erase Ball: Basically similar to dodge ball where there is a couple of balls placed in the middle of the court with two teams of at least 5 on each side. The objective of the game is to get all the members of the other team out by hitting them with one of the erase balls. However the difference in this game from dodge ball is that if the erase ball makes contact with your body, whichever body part it was will be erased, meaning you no longer can use it. An example would be that if you got hit in your left leg, you would not be able to use it anymore and would have to stand only on your right leg since your left leg was ""erased"". If you got hit in the torso or stomach however, everything from the place you got hit down would be ""erased"". The only way to be able to get back your lost body parts is if you catch a ball. One body part can be replaced back per catch. If you missed the catch however you will lose whatever hand or arm or whatever the part of the body the ball made contact with. Time limit for games is usually ten minutes or Unlimited if you are playing ""fight to the death"" style. The court will be around 20 ft long and each team will stand 10ft away from where the balls are in the middle prior to whistle being blown to start the game. In the ten minute games, crossing the line prior to the 5 min mark result in an automatic erase which means the player is out. However, at the 5 min mark, players may move over 5 ft from the middle to other team territory to gain an advantage. At the 1 min mark, free reign of the whole court is viable and there are no boundaries. Wins can be determined by the number of players completely erased and by the number of body part that are left on a persons body. Major body parts will be counted only. So the head, two hands, two forearms, two shoulders, two thighs, two shins, and two feet. If there is a tie, then team captains will square off on a one on one battle. Some special rules that should also be known is that no teammate can be returned even if you catch a ball and still have all your body parts, unless it is a shot to the to head. Head shot is an automatic kill.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

Also it would make it more fun to create each game to have a theme such as pertaining  to the holidays or season or events going on at the time. Such as hallowen, the objects could be small pumpkins. Or on the forth of july the objects could be red white and blue. And each color was worth different points. Also you could score them on thier dive i9nto the water and a buzzer could go off to began the game and if you dived well or did a specific trick that would add extra points. Also if you collected other objects that werent the main objects to grab, but they pertained to the certain themed and you captured them and put those in the hoop or just collected them and set them down when you came up for air. Also it could be more like a scavenger hunt under water with clues at the beggigng before you jumped in and the targets were harder to find, and you had to actully look for them in the obsticle course.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

The offensive objective will be to get a ball and score it in the basket.

What would also be interesting, would be if every single team member does not know one another personally at all. Within each of these teams, there will be a snake; this team members job is to purposely mess up the team they are on so the other team wins. If the other team wins, they will win a cash prize.

2648,5,"What type of ball would be used for this sport? I think the best type of ball would be something between a soccer and volleyball. Must be sturdy enough to deal with the kicks, but soft enough to not hurt the arms. The goal would be something between a goal and the members of the other team not being able to reach the ball in time. The referee must use his judgement to determine this. Also, physical contact between members of opposing teams should be allowed, I'm not talking about straight up punching someone for the ball, but distracting someone, taking the ball away from them, slightly bumping into them, should all be okay and not considered fouls. This will make the members of the teams think of strategies and will make every team different from one another because while one of the teams may be very physical in order to score, other teams may be very precise in their thinking and clean in order to score. This will make for the good vs evil concept that most fans have towards different teams, always thinking that their team is the best one, even when they lose miserably.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

The people in the pool do not have the opportunity to score unless they are outside the pool and on the field. In order to get out of the pool and be able to score points for yourself, the dodge balls that are in the pool as a result of the offensive player's objective to score will be used by the pool players to try to tag the outside offensive players(as they try to score). So if the offensive player gets tagged by a dodge ball by a pool player, they essentially trade places and then the pool player gets out of the pool and has the opportunity to score (again, the scoring objective is in the pool somewhere).  Essentially, the offensive field players need proximity to the pool in order to score and the pool players utilize this proximity to tag that player out to get an opportunity to score for themselves. In the aspect of fairness, there should be equal opportunity for each (pool players and field players) to score. So, players who started out on the field in round 1 have to start in the pool in round 2.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

So it can't be, you reach 20, use the dart, then the other team uses the dart on you and then your team goes back to 20 so you get another one. But you don't have to use the dart once you get it, you may keep it for later on, but only the person who reached the 20 mark may use it. Maybe at 35 you get an air pump which you may use for the rest of the round so one person could be pumping air into balloons while the rest continue to gather balloons. There could also be some balloon animals that are more points than regular balloons. And maybe even balloons of different color have different points. Like red, blue, orange, and green are 1 point, purple, white, and black are 2, and yellow/gold be 3.

Holding the ball for more than 4 seconds would result in the other team getting the ball. Fouling somebody as they are attempting to score will result in one free throw.

Each team would start with five balls on each side, to eliminate someone from the opposing team you would need to strike the body of the opposing player or catch a ball thrown at you, similar to dodge ball. However the difference is once a player is eliminated from the regular playing field they would move to the ""zone"" which is directly behind the opposing team.

Ten of the 14 playing dodgeballs will be divided between the two teams at the start of the possession, while the other 4 will be lined up on the 50 yard goal line, free for anyone to grab at any point of the game.

The ""carrier"", (the person who is carrying the ball) can not place the ball on the floor, but he/she can pass it to another team mate. If the ball hits the floor, it is a change a possession and it must be thrown or kicked to the opposing team. Once the opposing team receives the ball, play continues. Players are eliminated when they are struck out with a hit from a dodgeball.

Instead of a quarterback, the game would have a kind of launcher for a ball, and other players would have to catch it or defend the launcher until he fires his shot. Because a player can't be knocked down underwater per se, the teams would wear flags of some kind to be pulled away to signify that they have to stop, and launch again in order to gain more distance towards the goal.While a launcher isn't perfect, because of the precision allowed by one, it'd be better to make a larger playing field. In football there are also multiple opportunities to make a certain yardage, perhaps in the case of this underwater incarnation, for each failure to make the needed distance, greater difficulty is applied by simulating water currents that make a shot more difficult, giving the defending team a greater chance of intercepting the ball or preventing their opponents from making a catch.","team, game, get, point, person, member, score, try, not, make"

One player would run to first base, and the other would start to run to third base therefore there wouldn't be any collisions. When it comes to both players running to second no one is safe; even though they are on the base they can still get tagged because rule is two people cant be on the same base at one time. They cant remain on their original bases either because it leaves it open for them to get tagged again because there would be two people on base. The number of players on each team at max is 10.

You can only score on a certain team 5 times within a period, if you manage to score more than 5 times, the point won't count. The basket is going to be about 5 feet high and there is going to be a goalie that is allow to deflect the ball but has to be 4 feet away from the goal. You are able to get a point if you shoot the ball into the goal. Style points will be included in people's shot so the fancy the shot is, the more points you get. A style shot counts as one shot but will give you a various amount of point. So lets say you've scored five times at the goal and they were all style shots worth 3 points each. You then have earned 15 points from that team and now have to move on to another basket. Now if the goalie deflects the ball and he isn't 4 feet away from the goal, the team loses a player for about 2 minutes. If a player also commits a foul, they will be out for one minute and if the player continues to foul, he earns another minute. Now the maximum amount of minutes a player can be out for is 5, once he commits his 6 foul the player is ejected from the game and the team loses the player permanently for the rest of the game. There will be three ten minute period and there will be a 5 minute over time if there is a tie within the teams. Each team is allowed 3 timeout throughout the whole game. Whenever you substitute players off the court, the game does not stop. If you do however have more than 5 players on the court, you'll be penalized with a player being out for a minute and a time out taken away from you.

Each ring is worth a different amount of points. The tallest one is 3 points, the middle is 2 points, and the lowest ring is 1 point. You will start the game of with six players on each team. There will be one person who can guard the rings and the other players can be placed strategically as needed (may use a basketball concept going by height). The way players start off will be to have an official punt the pigskin in the air slightly above their heads as they are standing in a circle. The circle will be set up with one player from team 1 and then a person from team 2 and so on until the ten players makes a circle. When traveling with the ball, the player can only have three steps and then must give up the ball (no dribbling). Once the ball is passed to another team mate, it can not be returned to the player that have given it to you unless there was an interception, then you can start over. The object of the game is to get the ball into the rings by defeating the keeper. The keeper can only stay in the circle around the rings which is about 6ft in circumference. The players can put the ball through either side of the rings. The players can only be called on for a foul inside the keepers circle. When a player is foul, 2 shots can be taken at the end of the ring and is only one point regardless of the ring it goes through (keeper is allowed to defend). If scored, take back to middle and repeat the beginning of game, otherwise keeper and can throw the ball out to player. Keepers cannot be taken out that will be a 2 min sit out of the player who did it. Games end after 2- 25 min halves. If the there is a tie, there will be a shoot out.

(at least the ones that are big here in the U.S.) We could have a sport that involved the volleyball, softball, baseball, soccer, basketball, and football concepts and rules. Luckily some of the sports intertwine with each other already such as basketball and soccer or softball and baseball. The sport would be played on a football field and have a soccer goal post and basketball net on each end zone. We would also have a volleyball net in the middle of the field where the game is started (just like basketball and soccer.) We would start off playing volleyball except instead of serving it and trying to get to 21 points, we would serve it once (a coin toss would determine who got to serve for the first half) and whoever got the point would then be able to attack the goal and basketball hoop. In order to get a point, we would have to shoot the ball with our hands and make it into the hoop and then with our feet BEFORE THE BALL IS DROPPED ON THE GROUND and kick the ball in the net. If a point is made you would then try for the extra point by kicking a field goal.

There will be two goal keepers, which means that the third goal box will be unprotected. Each team will be responsible for keeping that goal box safe, respectively. For example, if a team member from team one scores a goal in the third goal box they will get the points. The other part of this game is that not only will it consist of twenty players in each team, but there will be up to three soccer balls in the filed. The purpose of this new sport is to see how team players engage to work together to achieve their goal.

The hoops will have different amounts of points, such as 3 for the highest one, 2 for the medium, and 1 for the shortest. There is no goalie, just a defense and offense position. If a player's sash is torn off, the player must throw the ball straight in the air for a free for all take, and the play has to put his sash back on right after to continue in the game.

Having three balls in the sport would generate more rapidity, and one could view the teams cohesiveness and how they work together when there are more balls in the field.

The point of the game is to get a small, lightweight ball through the hoop suspended in the air.

There would also be a border as to where the ball would still be considered in play so power shots will still have effect in the game.

For this to be more challenging a smaller ball with more mass would work best and have 2 balls instead of 1 ball in play . The ball hitting the ground to score points would remain the same. A net is not necessary a thick wire would be good and the ball must be thrown over the wire. Players can't be within five feet of the wire this is so they cant just jump and throw it straight down that would be to easy. Just like volleyball each ball can only be thrown 3 times, The third time has to be across the wire.

However, unlike kickball in order to get someone out you have to hit them with the ball instead of throwing it a man on base.  You can do this to any person on the opposing team whether he/she is on base or not just as long as they have kicked the ball and have not scored yet. You can also get a player out by catching the ball after it has been kicked, but if the ball hits the wall and you catch it then it is not an out. The ball used in the sport can be a volleyball or soccer ball (they both are easily kick-able) and it is played with 7 players on each team.  You must get four outs before your team can go back on offense.  The time constraints for the game is 45 minutes not split up into quarters, halves, or periods.  Just straight through.  Anybody on defense can beg a runner with a ball, it doesn't have to be the pitcher.  The game is played in a gymnasium with a basketball hoop on either side. If the kicker manages to make the ball through the goal he must take off his shirt, and scream while sprinting around the bases.  It is also 3 points.  The defense can also at any time try and punt the ball into the other goal (right by home plate) but it must be from at least 60 feet away.  If successful it would be counted as an out and 1 point.  There should be either a clear wall or metal fence between the action and the bleachers so fans do not get hit with the ball. You cannot tackle another player but it is okay to peg the person with the ball no matter how close they are to you.  Head shots are discouraged but allowed.

The players would be skilled hang-gliders that are experts in controlling the airborne vehicle.  Players would then be give sticks similar to lacrosse sticks.  Then the ball would have some sort of anti-gravity mechanism that can keep it at a certain level unless a player makes contact with it.  If the player scoops the ball up and throws it, it will fly.

By using their sticks, hang gliders, and teammates, players will work towards advancing the ball into the goal.  players will start off at a high peak or maybe even off of a plane to where they will then hang glide down and race to the ball where it will be placed in a neutral location for both teams to retrieve.
