			"Possibly add on to the race by getting into a 2 person go kart and do the same thing. Make the race a three or four event marathon. The locations of this sport could also be located in different regions. Regions like the desert, jungle, mountains, and other extreme weathered areas. Or just create a huge dome that involves all four seasons with some areas being fairly easy to compete in and others being in the harshest areas. This sport could be an international one, due to the weather having a huge factor in the sport; different people from around the world would have an advantage in one area than another based on their environment that they live in."

			"To make the game more interesting, teammates could be split up on each side of the field and whether that team is on offense or defense determines what body parts they can use. For instance, If your team is on offense, you can only use your feet, defense only with their hands. Of course, if there was a \"goalie\" of some type, they could use both. Also, implement a time threat. Where if one team does not get the ball across the half way point of the field it would be considered a \"back court\" and a turnover. This would prevent any delay and chance for fans to get bored watching."
