Whoever finishes first wins. This is like a relay race. There would have to be obstacles set up for each individual. Or, this sport could be done with teams (like you sprint to one point and tag your team member to complete the next sprint and set of obstacles, like that track&field event where you pass the baton). Some other ideas of obstacles could include: crawling under shock wires in the mud, walking on a narrow beam (like a tightrope), climbing up a wall... open to other suggestions. Think of track and field events with sprints between events and obstacles. Types of events and obstacles could be drawn from track and field events, or obstacles in \"tough mudder\" races. This is a test of endurance, strength, coordination, and agility."

If you get a hole in one (ideally the chances of a hole in one would be greater if the distance from tee to hole was shortened), then you play the \"cup game\" where a cup is placed over all 3 holes, including the one you got your ball in. You know which hole your originally shot your ball in, but the referee\/umpire mixes up the 3 cups so that you don't know which one your ball is under. If you guess correctly, you get to keep your points from your hole in one (open to ideas on a scoring\/points system), but if you guess incorrectly, you lose all your points (again, contingent on the points\/scoring system. so maybe you lose points, maybe you gain a zillion points - which would be bad in a real game of golf - or maybe you get a spanking... open to ideas here). Tally up points\/spankings\/whatever at the end of the game. Obviously if you've made a few hole in ones and guessed where your ball was incorrectly you lose based on your inability to play the cup game (even if you're a good golfer)."

On each team there is a 'general', whose gun has such qualities that when they tag a member of their own team with it, the place the next bullet hits is where that person will be 'warped' to instantly. The general also has a bird's eye view of the field, allowing them to place members strategically so as to achieve the objective."
