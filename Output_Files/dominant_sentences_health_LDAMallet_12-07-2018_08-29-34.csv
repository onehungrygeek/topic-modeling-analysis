0,0,40.09 %,"healthcare, system, government, good, provide, agree, price, program, tax, benefit","Less government short of Anarchy is what our goal should be here. Understandably there should be standards set, education of physicians and medical personnel, medications, so on and so forth. But to the point in which the government wants to compete, and directly effect the healthcare system? This is where it has gone to far. Forcing every American to buy insurance, lying by saying that the penalties of not doing so is a tax. You can read the health care plan after it is passed???? This is terrifying, that the average American will stand for this, and reelect the same individuals responsible, and their excuse, "" Well at least they are trying"". 40% of americans are on some form of government assistance, and the president keeps saying that things are getting better, and more and more americans are out of work, many illegals receive free healthcare, while not paying taxes. Many americans receive benefits while sitting on their -----, and not contributing in their lifetimes while everyone else has to. As said by a famous scholar, every democracy will die, once its people realize that they can elect themselves benefits, or as we may know it ""freebees"". There should be no discussion past regulations."
1,1,35.81 %,"health, care, cost, medical, pay, free, service, reduce, low, lot","i dont think that a different outlook or perspective will change health care that much if any.  someone who has less of an income than one who is overly wealthy are still both logical thinking people.  what it comes down to is that healthcare profs. have budgets.  users of health care services have bills.  if bills are paid, then budgets stay the same or increase.  if bills aren't paid, then budgets are lowered.  when budgets are lowered then so are services, treatment quality, staff...it's all connected and eventually plummets because hospitals/healthcare has to pay to people to work. if they can't pay because ""users"" dont pay their bills, then everything goes to crap....make people pay their bills, (either hold them personally reliable if no insurance, hold the insurance if they have it or make people HAVE insurance so that somewhere, someone can get paid and continue to work."
2,2,54.42 %,"school, thing, education, high, student, child, educate, class, put, day","reform our educational system in a way that once someone enters high school (after their freshman year so they can get a feel for how school is) they are forced to choose whether they want to further pursue a college degree or enter the work force right out of school. After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someone  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more. For far too long have I seen students in high school being taught math and science they never use in day to day activities when they don't even plan to go to college this education of these subjects to people who choose to enter the workforce waste so much time doing this that they have to wait and have no experience in how to get the jobs and once they do get the job they don't know how to do the required tasks in an adequate manner."
3,3,43.92 %,"people, money, problem, drug, medicine, disease, life, live, place, issue","I find it quite mind boggling to know that some people are selling generic brands of different medicines for example a type of medicine for cancer and shipping it to America being that, a women in china was labeled a fraud for smuggling drugs such as a drug for cancer and she has a lab in America and the medicine is made there and placed on shelves in the pharmacy's which is really sad so people really need to be careful with dealing with medicine now days getting the actual brand is more on the save side but as stated previously, you really have to pay careful attention now days because drugs that are smuggled in to America look like the exact pill quite scary but very informational to know the difference and be aware of the difference types of medicines to take for different reasons."
4,4,36.11 %,"doctor, patient, time, hospital, nurse, medication, emergency_room, technology, emergency, wait",this seems like a great idea but the app may tend to have glitches and can have technical problems. And also people come and go so not everybody will know that this app exsist and not everyone has a smart phone and has access to this app. the doctors time he spends with his patients varys so he may not always be on time for the next patient thats why there are so many people waiting in the waiting room. everyone has their own clinical problems but if the doctor can at least spend with each patient for 30 minutes it will help with the waiting time for the other patients.
5,5,36.0 %,"insurance, make, healthy, pay, work, company, afford, food, person, family","Prescription medication. As it stands now, I think it is fine. Everyone should not be entitled to cheap meds. You pay more for full auto insurance over just liability right? But you also are covered in more areas. With that said, if you pay more for health care that covers more, your meds will be covered. If you cant afford it, then oh well, go try harder. Americans complain and complain they had a 100 dollar co-pay. Why are you complaining, the meds cost a heck of a lot more to research, develop, get a approved... hell im not going to explain the business process here, you get it. In short, if you cant afford 100 dollars, then maybe you should look down at your feet and regret paying 98$ for those nikes you are wearing"
