			"I have an idea for a sport called \"Freethrow\".  It starts off with two separate teams of 5 players each.  The two teams go into a rectangular field\/court that has a set of rings on either side.  Each side of the field has 3 rings suspended in the air, each at different heights or diameters.  The objective is for a team to throw a boomerang, or some other projectile, through the rings in order to earn points for their team.  Depending on how challenging it is to throw through the ring determines the amount of points a team will receive.  The players must get to their opponent's side of the field by passing the boomerang from one player on a team to another.  This is where it could get a little challenging due to the curved trajectory of the boomerang.  If an opposing player intercepts a pass, he may begin to run to the other side of the field.  Once a team does score, the opposing team starts off with the boomerang and can run to the other side of the field.  The game will be divided into two separate halves.  In between each half, the teams switch sides so that it is fair if there is a problem due to wind blowing in one direction."

Instead of a quarterback, the game would have a kind of launcher for a ball, and other players would have to catch it or defend the launcher until he fires his shot. Because a player can't be knocked down underwater per se, the teams would wear flags of some kind to be pulled away to signify that they have to stop, and launch again in order to gain more distance towards the goal.",

In football there are also multiple opportunities to make a certain yardage, perhaps in the case of this underwater incarnation, for each failure to make the needed distance, greater difficulty is applied by simulating water currents that make a shot more difficult, giving the defending team a greater chance of intercepting the ball or preventing their opponents from making a catch."

They will all continue to alternate sides throughout the activity until there is one ultimate winner. The players will be eliminated throughout the course of the game every time a player fails to return the ball. Once the player has returned the ball, he\/she must assure that their \"toss\" back to the opponent is within ten feet of net (there would be lines taped\/painted on the floor to mark the ten foot range). If the player's toss is past the ten foot range, then the players toss will be considered out of bounds, and the tosser will be eliminated. In this game players on the same side do not typically help one-another as they are all against each other."
