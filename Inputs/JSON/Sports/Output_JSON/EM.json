			"Sodgeball- The combination of soccer and dodge-ball. Unlike soccer- the team will not consist of 11 but rather 6 people on a team similar to dodge ball. The rules are similar to dodgeball except that instead of throwing it, we can only kick the ball at other people. Rules are simple, if you get hit- you're out. This continues until the opposing team has no more players. Each team starts off with only 3 balls. Unlike dodgeball- catching the opposing team's ball does nothing except eliminate you, however, if you kick a ball that was kicked at you before it touches the ground and it hits a player on the opposing team then the player on the opposing team is eliminated--and if it hits the player who kicked it initially then that person is out and a person on your team who was out can come back in. Also if a ball happens to hit a player in the head or groin then the person who kicked the ball gets a red card and is out indefinitely for the remainder of the game. The game is best out of three rounds so two wins is necessary, players who are penalized for kicking the ball to the head or groin are still punished and cannot join the game for the second and third round."

			"This idea is a spoof off of Qudditch from Harry Potter.  Players would split up into teams and be given hang-gliders.  The players would be skilled hang-gliders that are experts in controlling the airborne vehicle.  Players would then be give sticks similar to lacrosse sticks.  Then the ball would have some sort of anti-gravity mechanism that can keep it at a certain level unless a player makes contact with it.  If the player scoops the ball up and throws it, it will fly.  If the player thrusts it down that it will fall down.  But gravity will be minimized by the mechanical ball. The purpose of the game will be to get the ball through a circular goal at a certain dimensional height in the sky.  By using their sticks, hang gliders, and teammates, players will work towards advancing the ball into the goal.  players will start off at a high peak or maybe even off of a plane to where they will then hang glide down and race to the ball where it will be placed in a neutral location for both teams to retrieve.  Then once a team recovers the ball, game on."

			"This idea is similar to the Hunger Games.  But instead of people dying they will just be \"out.\"  This sport will involve many skills and aptness to take advantage of random supplies that players will receive.  Players will be given a sort of light sabres that don't actually cut a limb off but are just used to simulate if a person was struck by the sabre at all.  The sport will take place in the woods and will last 48 hours. Players will have to survive with the objects that they receive from the \"referees.\"   To object of the game isn't to last the longest, however it is to gain the most points.  If you cause someone to be out(supposedly  die) then they will gain points.  If they find a certain object that is hidden they will gain points.  If they use the materials they receive in a clever way they will gain points.  The game will end once there is a last man standing and the winner will be the one with the most points."

				"This game as stated by the title requires two things: A scooter and a maze of some sort. In this game there can be multiple teams but only if the size of the maze is big enough. Teams can have up to 6 members. Point of the game is to go from one section of the maze to the center of the maze. But the difference is only one person per team can go in at a time. When the first player reaches a certain point in the game the other team members outside of the maze will be notified when the next member can enter. Winners are based on, obviously, which teams or team gets all members to the center as quickly as possible."
			],
			[
				"In the game there will be many obstacles players will face. Some can include puzzles, riddles, traps, dead ends, quick sand, etc. The only objective is to get to their goal as quickly as possible. One thing about this game that it is in complete darkness and each player when entering the maze is given a backpack that includes water, a rock, drawing paper, and a flashlight. But a catch to the game is, if the previous player who entered the maze was the fastest the next member, on that team, is allowed communication and can ask the first member for aid and advice.  There are no rounds, everything is timed and only, of course, one team can win."

				"Another sport that could be made is air jet racing. In this game players are given backpack rockets, that allow them to fly. The point of the game is to be the first person to land at a certain location. This game can be played in teams or in singles. There will be 7 different locations players must get to. At each location players will find a simple riddle that will guide them to their next stop along with a letter. At the end of the game after everyone has arrived at the last location players must try and figure out what the the letters together spell.  Players will be using their rockets to fly from one location to another."
			],
			[
				"The game allows for the rockets to be able to change the speed of how fast players can fly but to fuel the rockets players need to use oil. Players can only get oil in certain spots while playing the game. If you run out of gas before reaching the final location then you are out the game. So players must also be aware of how much gas they are using up and if they can fill it up. There is one thing though: A player can get gas at anytime but they will be penalized by being forced to \"freeze\", which means stop what they are doing, for a certain amount of time. Players must remember they have only 24 hours to finish getting to all the location. So in this game it is possible for none of the players to win the game. Also, apart from everything else mention players do receive a map in the beginning of the game so they can track their path. All players will be given the same locations but they will race each other to see who can do so the fastest."

			"I like your addition to the sport.The only problem I see with that is that a player might camp out and hide the whole game and automatically be admitted to sudden death just be lasting the whole game. Initially, the original author of the game tried to prevent campers by giving the player with the most points at the end the edge rather than the player that lasts the longest.  I love the idea of a player earning double points from using materials found in nature for gadgets rather than materials given to him."
