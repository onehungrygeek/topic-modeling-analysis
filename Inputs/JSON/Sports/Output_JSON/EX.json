			"This new sport will consist of two teams with up to twenty players in each. The setting of this sport will be held at a soccer field with three goal boxes, two being on the ends of the field and one in the middle. There will be two goal keepers, which means that the third goal box will be unprotected. Each team will be responsible for keeping that goal box safe, respectively. For example, if a team member from team one scores a goal in the third goal box they will get the points. The other part of this game is that not only will it consist of twenty players in each team, but there will be up to three soccer balls in the filed. The purpose of this new sport is to see how team players engage to work together to achieve their goal. I would love to call this sport, 2-3-20."
