The taggers objective is to dribble the ball around the court (different countries) and maintain control and eventually shoot into a designated goal (the capital of that country.) There will be 3 different countries at different corners in the gym, at each one a chosen member earlier who was designated as one that is traveling the world will work together with the tagger to score. The civilians at this are playing defense and resisting the goal. When either the tagger or the ally traveling the world with them finally scores they make a successful pass across the gym to one of the other players traveling the world. However, if the defense gains control of the ball then the entire traveling team has to run 2 laps around the designated playing area."
