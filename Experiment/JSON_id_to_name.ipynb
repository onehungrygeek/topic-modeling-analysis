In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health.
