36	The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care.	healthcare system changed features: healthcare cost reduced low income unemployed people family afford. obama care forced bring health care services ability pay hospital bill education system, doctors, specialists, practitioners deep educated good trained give service patient family part okay. order save time money, medical technology improve give health care service patients. example, robots doctors surgery, invented radiology scanner reduce radio way, uv ray, ultrasound wave, etc. equal health care services cost low canada, australia. insurance, obama care people obtain sick. affect health service, people option taking care health efficiency. moreover, education teach doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, people work healthcare patient health important else, taking insurance making fast diagnostic. aspect see, doctors, physician, specialists, nurses pay attention topic. medicine lowered price generic medication afford buy insurance not. people taking care health. lastly, maintaining good health make live don't healthcare services time sick people care.	-1	March 28, 2013, 11:47:58 AM	56a55	Daniel Gray

To the LGBT community, they also needs to be treated equally to other people regardless race, age, background, etc. And this is the task of the health care providers who are responsible in providing them the best quality health service. People who is in the Nursing home would be suffered so many problems and can't get away from aging, so they need to have a good care even about mental, physical, and social health treatment to make them enjoy the rest of life. It should be more health care show or programs as many health issue commercials to everyone to make an announcement or warning about any thing related to health like overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, STDs, HIV thread, etc. There are now many and many case of rape related in the healthcare system, so it needs to pass a law or some restriction rules to reduce this issue as guaranteed the good working environment to all healthcare employees.	thing, mention previous post, are: disable people, hiv/aids patients, etc. diseases, treated fairly normal people, weaker depress time life mental, physical, social health. lgbt community, treated equally people race, age, background, etc. task health care providers responsible providing quality health service. people nursing home suffered problems can't aging, good care mental, physical, social health treatment make enjoy rest life. health care show programs health issue commercials make announcement warning thing related health overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, stds, hiv thread, etc. case rape related healthcare system, pass law restriction rules reduce issue guaranteed good working environment healthcare employees.	-1	April 02, 2013, 11:20:30 AM	56a55	Daniel Gray

29	Adderol abuse in colleges is becoming a serious problem. Not to mention certain pharmaceuticals are the root of most illegal drugs being made in America today. Doctor's usually only get to see their patient once in situations where they diagnose, therefore they pass out prescriptions as a precautionary measure instead of actually reasoning if the patient truly needs the prescription. There needs to be discrete testing (i.e. personality tests or motor skills testing) that could be done in the waiting room or online before an appointment so the doctor can assess the results and have a better understanding of the patients true psychological, mental, or physical well-being before they're forced to diagnose the patient in one sitting.	adderol abuse colleges problem. mention pharmaceuticals root illegal drugs made america today. doctor's patient situations diagnose, pass prescriptions precautionary measure reasoning patient prescription. discrete testing (i.e. personality tests motor skills testing) waiting room online appointment doctor assess results understanding patients true psychological, mental, physical well-being they're forced diagnose patient sitting.	5	March 29, 2013, 01:21:41 PM	93c34	Steven Cooper

32	The Health Care System right now is forcing too much upon the people and businesses as well. The main concern shouldn't be making every single person in American pay for every service that most will not use just so that a few can take advantage of it. The main concern should focus on helping the lower class who needs the services, obtain the standard of living that can provide them. Instead of throwing billions of tax dollars into food stamps and welfare checks, focus that money into creating the mass amounts of jobs that encourage the poor to get back on their feet, rather than giving to them handouts that encourage laying down.	health care system forcing people businesses well. main concern shouldn't making single person american pay service advantage it. main concern focus helping lower class services, obtain standard living provide them. throwing billions tax dollars food stamps welfare checks, focus money creating mass amounts jobs encourage poor back feet, giving handouts encourage laying down.	-1	March 29, 2013, 01:40:46 PM	93c34	Steven Cooper

34	"The health care system was built around helping your neighbor in a sense. In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education. Education would help reduce the work load through people going to where they are suppose to go for a given emergency, not to mention them themselves eating healthier, treating themselves better, etc..."

Because everyone makes different amounts of income the cost of health care should cost accordingly. 	health care affordable. cost living cost staying alive shouldn't well. taxes, government takes percentage based person makes, cost health care way. makes amounts income cost health care cost accordingly. 	-1	April 01, 2013, 10:33:49 AM	46d42	Barbara Perez

11	"When someone is overweight and they want to loose weight they will most likely go to the doctor and ask what the doctor has for them as a solution. Most doctors will suggest lipo-suction, body wraps, or weight loss pills. But has a doctor ever prescribed a healthy meal plan, or a work out schedule? Of course not! America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it. What a caring doctor should prescribe is a dose of ""lay off on the McDonalds"", work out regularly and choose to be healthy. A healthy mindset can also build the confidence of a person for a lifetime and is the fuel for motivation."

I think this is sad America, $5000 seems like a reasonable amount but the fact that insurance does not cover the cost of this surgery makes me sick to my stomach.

46	It is common knowledge that corporate employees of a business make literally hundreds of times more than scantily paid lower-level employees. With that in mind, what if there were a maximum wage employed to go alongside the minimum wage? With a more equally distributed propagation of profits, more people could afford more. Why struggle more than we have to? The monster that stands in the way is greed. Anyway... Ideally, CEOs would still make enough of their share to afford their extra cake/comfortability while entry-level employees would actually be able to afford the health care the companies boast about offering. If there were some type of ratio that limited how much a business owner could make versus a cashier, I'd be for it. Example: At a time, Ben and Jerry's ice cream company had a 7 to 1 ratio. (The numbers off the top of my head might not be exact, but it is the point that matters.) At any time, the owners could only make seven times more than the lower workers. That certainly beats other more common CEOS that make 578 times more than their wage slaves who sweat for $7.25 today.	common knowledge corporate employees business make literally hundreds times scantily paid lower-level employees. mind, maximum wage employed alongside minimum wage? equally distributed propagation profits, people afford more. struggle to? monster stands greed. anyway... ideally, ceos make share afford extra cake/comfortability entry-level employees afford health care companies boast offering. type ratio limited business owner make versus cashier, i'd it. example: time, ben jerry's ice cream company 7 1 ratio.

If animal-derived products are to be consumed, it should overall be on a lesser scale and certainly without added hormones, cruelty, and filthiness of factory farms. For example, the average factory farmed chicken after hormones and antibiotics is fattened to multiple times what its natural weight would be. It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news. PSAs should be developed to lessen usage of animal products or to promote vegetarianism for health.	factory farms outlawed. animal-derived products consumed, lesser scale added hormones, cruelty, filthiness factory farms. example, average factory farmed chicken hormones antibiotics fattened multiple times natural weight be. eventually forced grow large legs longer support body. studies shown consumption chickens detrimentally affected physical development pubescent girls, causing start menstrual cycles early 8 years addition, develop breasts early. least, factory farms outlawed, undercover investigations broadcasted news. psas developed lessen usage animal products promote vegetarianism health.	-1	April 10, 2013, 10:26:31 AM	46k81	William Diaz

1	I believe that a Universal Healthcare program such as the one in effect in Canada, or other Western European nations such as the UK, Germany, France, or Australia, is the way to the greater good. All of those nations have healthcare, and sterling economies. Treatment for certain conditions like cancer, for example, are difficult to overcome even with large paychecks. The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. No one in the 21st century, living in the world's most affluent nation, should be denied access to healthcare. Tax rates may increase slightly, but it will be for the overall betterment of society.	universal healthcare program effect canada, western european nations uk, germany, france, australia, greater good. nations healthcare, sterling economies. treatment conditions cancer, example, difficult overcome large paychecks. manner banks monitor credit means people forced choose ignoring treatment, ruining credit history, make taking loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. 21st century, living world's affluent nation, denied access healthcare. tax rates increase slightly, betterment society.	-1	April 06, 2013, 10:35:12 AM	43n78	Zachary Cortez
2	I believe that pharmaceuticals should be made available to patients, at minimal costs; provided they have a prescription for it of course.

For example, doctors can be made eligible for lower interest rates when taking out mortgages or perhaps their children can be provided with reduced fiscal costs. The idea is that reduced expenses will negate their somewhat reduced earnings which would occur from lowered healthcare bills.	subsidizing companies far. doctor's reluctant reduce earnings. problem circumvented government laws assist doctors ways. example, doctors made eligible lower interest rates taking mortgages children provided reduced fiscal costs. idea reduced expenses negate reduced earnings occur lowered healthcare bills.	-1	April 06, 2013, 10:54:25 AM	43n78	Zachary Cortez

8	I believe that education is the fundamental root of every possible changes in the country. By supporting education, specially in healthcare profession, we can produce more doctors, nurses, and others related healthcare career. The term of supporting education I mean is, for example provide more scholarships for students, provide more opportunity and more campaign to level up the interested of student in Healthcare profession careers. Also, provide more opportunity to international student so they will be able to work in the US, provide more funds and affordable education to low-income student. Tuition needs to be flat rate, rather than keep going up every year. No one would be able to continue their education in a higher level of education if they know they will be broke after graduating.	education fundamental root country. supporting education, specially healthcare profession, produce doctors, nurses, related healthcare career. term supporting education is, provide scholarships students, provide opportunity campaign level interested student healthcare profession careers. also, provide opportunity international student work us, provide funds affordable education low-income student. tuition flat rate, year. continue education higher level education broke graduating.	-1	April 06, 2013, 01:29:22 PM	74n39	Meagan Johnson

This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living.	don't healthcare system like, main idea healthcare system people themselves. said, suggest healthcare flexible people living poor area provide family. good idea system make people aware actual problems. example, give ideas benefit system aware outline procedure detail. biggest problem is, receives healthcare system, idea generate base individuals healthcare rewards persons' living.	-1	March 04, 2013, 10:18:54 AM	94x11	Sharon Morris

Free sounds great, but if humans can not wait for 3 hours in the Doc's office can you imagine waiting 5 months to be seen? Our health care is slow with burnout staff, and out dated equipment. And this will never change for the private sector has no power on this, the only hope is Government steps. Going back to cars, there is no reason a GMC should have more technology in the dash board then the office i sit in to get my back checked out.

23	Educating the masses in a variety of areas of health care, especially the ones who are prone to make injunctions of their own health as well as potentially harming others around them, could save a lot of money. Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.	educating masses variety areas health care, prone make injunctions health potentially harming them, save lot money. unaware dangers drugs teenage pregnancies cost money unable pay hospital expenses. educating individuals crap i've experienced school stop people realize effects actions society. people life support family pay riches alive. decisions made technology save people. care elderly people, mentally unstable, persons severe mental in-capabilities paid government insurance companies people cared for, cases aren't any. disabled, physically otherwise, unable unwilling contribute society shape form hinder progress reform literally fiscally taking space advance technology save people illness put order utilize resources effectively. doctors psychiatrists apt hand prescriptions drugs, mental disorders depression. creates problems patients hospitalized obtaining, buying patient stealing them, drugs manners intended for. treatment drugs resort means patients office. possibly subsidizing costs hospital expenses lower costs hospitals pay, lower insurance costs out-of-pocket expenses patients. people responsible, taught be, health care costs. uninsured person emergency room, time make person health insurance, rest society pay literally hospitals cut back staff, technology quality medicine procedures. explore possibilities advanced technology potentially cut back spending removing invasive costly surgeries therapy.	-1	March 04, 2013, 01:38:22 PM	17x14	Kevin Campbell
24	"There are some insurance companies that require a full physical before the will carry you almost like a pass or fail; If you you pass with good health you get a more affordable rate. However, most people with low incomes aren't able to afford all of the necessary things it takes to stay healthy like buying Organic foods, gym memberships, and supplements, etc. So these people are forced to either pay a higher insurance rate or have none at all. I do agree that there should be an incentive to leading a healthy lifestyle and maybe if gym memberships or ""healthy food"" discounts were offered through our employers or insurance companies it would help aid to a healthier lifestyle where healthcare wasn't such a burden."

They immediately wanted to put me on the most expensive medication they could find ( which had a whole laundry list of side affects itself).

Don't let a trauma 1 victim come in, because then everyone will be pushed back.	emergency room services priority system is, acute er head injury (possible concussion) fever...they're left good 15-30 minutes emergency moment. don't trauma 1 victim in, pushed back.	-1	April 25, 2013, 10:59:15 AM	16y48	Mrs. Sheila Jones

80	Affordability, quality and accessibility are some of the characteristics of a good healthcare system. Quality;          Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.  I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have.    	affordability, quality accessibility characteristics good healthcare system. quality;          quality important property healthcare system. order practice great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  trained. training include educational learning medical schools ability operate kinds tools, soft wares, equipments needed carryout respective roles. training include social skills interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills critical thinking skills. also, order provide healthcare, healthcare facilities equipped, easily accessible, date terms modernization. accessibility;      apart quality healthcare system, patients accessible quality care afford not. don't thing wards someone's life; matter race, religion ethnicity. personally wrong turn afford pay. sad lot people refused prescription pharmacy pay time blame people pharmacy business.  problem systematic angle component contribute healthcare problems have.    	-1	April 25, 2013, 12:44:06 PM	92y54	Tammy Fischer
81	For one how  is the private sector going to do anything better. The people receiving the care, cannot hold the private sector accountable. Yet, you can always challenge the government when it does something wrong, its called supreme court cases. Second, it is inhumane to not give somebody healthcare because they are not a citizen of the US. Third it is the private companies that set the the price, the private sector is only concerned with profit, which in turn means worst financial strain on the care receiver.	how  private sector better. people receiving care, hold private sector accountable. yet, challenge government wrong, called supreme court cases. second, inhumane give healthcare citizen us. private companies set price, private sector concerned profit, turn means worst financial strain care receiver.	68	April 25, 2013, 03:44:26 PM	85y74	Melissa Kelly

After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someone  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more. For far too long have I seen students in high school being taught math and science they never use in day to day activities when they don't even plan to go to college this education of these subjects to people who choose to enter the workforce waste so much time doing this that they have to wait and have no experience in how to get the jobs and once they do get the job they don't know how to do the required tasks in an adequate manner.	reform educational system enters high school (after freshman year feel school is) forced choose pursue college degree enter work force school. freshman year (beginning sophomore year) student choose branch educational process teaching complex mathematics, sciences, histories type path suited someone  wanting continue education past high school. contrary branch workforce driven classes explore types jobs high school diploma, classes teaching everyday setting insurance, saving money groceries (smart shopping), personal preventive care (how care dependents), home ec classes, trade skills students pursue high school. overlay subjects personal preventive care, job search techniques, more. long students high school taught math science day day activities don't plan college education subjects people choose enter workforce waste time wait experience jobs job don't required tasks adequate manner.	-1	April 25, 2013, 01:14:47 PM	99z32	Melissa Hughes
