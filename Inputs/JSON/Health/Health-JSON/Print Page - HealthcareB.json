If people had more of a say they would feel like they get what they pay for and be more satisfied with the health care system. People like to have control, give patients more rights to decide on what they want. Don't allow insurance companies to make our decisions for us, but then here comes the problem of education... most people don't even know their options... How can we give people more control?",

  "content": "The way free health care works in other countries is that people still have insurance in case of very serious cases, however, free healthcare is administered to people to educate them on how to take very good care of their bodies and not attain very contagious diseases. for example the general check-ups and the occasional flu will be treated under the free health care system. But, emergencies will require a valid health insurance. by doing this the price of prescription drugs will be elevated and insurance might be able to cover this; so it will still be necessary to have insurance.",
