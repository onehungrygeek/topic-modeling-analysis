			"I really enjoy games like hide and go seek and I also believe that a sport doesnt just have to involve working out your body but it can also involve working out the brain. Therefore, the sport that I would like to create would incorporate the physical aspect and mental aspect. My ideal setting for my sport to be played would be in a very jungle type atmosphere, or simply a traditional forest or are with many trees. The overalll idea of my sport would be to go into this forest like area, individually, but are assigned to a group that they will have to figure out who they are as they go. There will be stations that have some kind of physical component to it (almost like obstacle coarse components that the army uses to train) or a mentally challenging activity. The individual will have to complete the physical task and once it is complete the person will have a card with a clue on it that will either lead them to the next task or give then a hint who is on their team. The first team that accumulated their team and then works together to get to the finish line wins."
