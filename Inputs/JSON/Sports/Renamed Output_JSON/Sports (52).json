			"Sport will be played with a small oval object that looks like an egg but weighs very little. it will be played on a soccer field. each team will have 22 players of which 16 will be on the field at a particular moment. there will be 6 referees present on the field. the aim of the game is to score 45 points to win the game. there will be 3 rounds and 15:00 minutes for each. however if no team has scored 45 points by the end of 3 rounds then 2 more will be added and if at the end of the 5 rounds no team has 45 points then the team with the highest amount of points wins. The \"egg\" must be thrown from between the legs. an individual is only allowed to hold the egg for 10 seconds then which the egg is automatically given to the next team. there are 4 boxes which is where points will be gotten from. there will be 2 on each side for each team. one will be large and placed on the boundary line and throwing the egg successfully into that box gets you a maximum of 1 point. the other box is smaller and further away i.e behind the boundary line and scoring in that box will get you a maximum of 5 points. if any member holding should step across the boundary line, the other team gets possesion of the egg. if your team is with the egg and is the last to touch it before it drops on the ground, the other team gets possesion of the egg. to score in the 1 point box, players must be at least 2 meters away from the box if not point will be disregarded. if there is any form of foul play, players will be given red cards and sent out of the game. in a situation where up to 11 players from your team is sent out, then you will be asked to forfeit the game. in a situation whereby each team has both 6 players left, the game will be won when the first team scores two 5-point shots."

			"This sport would take place on a court similar to a basketball or volleyball court. There would be 3 circles on the ground, each circle representing a different goal. The object of the game would be for your team to get the most number of balls into the goals. There would be a total of 10 balls each game. Every time a ball entered a circle, the ball would be removed from the game. The team to get the most goals would win. Each circle is allowed to have one \"goalie\" that cannot stand in the goal but can circle it and move around it and block it. Each team is allowed to have 8 players on the court at one time (3 goalies and 5 players). You can only touch the ball with your feet. If a player touches the ball with their hands, they must sit out for a total of 1 minute, therefore leaving their team one player short during that time."

			"This sport requires 5 teams of 3. There is one goal, or basket, on one end of a narrow field, and the goal is to get your teams ball into your goal as many times as you can in a 15 minute period. Players can only hold the ball with their hands, if a ball touches the ground in any way, the team must return to the starting end of the field. The team can only pass the ball by tossing or throwing it. Each time a goal is made, the team must return to the starting line to begin again. The narrow field causes the teams to inevitably interfere with one another. If a ball is intercepted by another team, the team who intercepted the ball automatically gets 1 point."

			"Erase Ball: Basically similar to dodge ball where there is a couple of balls placed in the middle of the court with two teams of at least 5 on each side. The objective of the game is to get all the members of the other team out by hitting them with one of the erase balls. However the difference in this game from dodge ball is that if the erase ball makes contact with your body, whichever body part it was will be erased, meaning you no longer can use it. An example would be that if you got hit in your left leg, you would not be able to use it anymore and would have to stand only on your right leg since your left leg was \"erased\". If you got hit in the torso or stomach however, everything from the place you got hit down would be \"erased\". The only way to be able to get back your lost body parts is if you catch a ball. One body part can be replaced back per catch. If you missed the catch however you will lose whatever hand or arm or whatever the part of the body the ball made contact with. Time limit for games is usually ten minutes or Unlimited if you are playing \"fight to the death\" style. The court will be around 20 ft long and each team will stand 10ft away from where the balls are in the middle prior to whistle being blown to start the game. In the ten minute games, crossing the line prior to the 5 min mark result in an automatic erase which means the player is out. However, at the 5 min mark, players may move over 5 ft from the middle to other team territory to gain an advantage. At the 1 min mark, free reign of the whole court is viable and there are no boundaries. Wins can be determined by the number of players completely erased and by the number of body part that are left on a persons body. Major body parts will be counted only. So the head, two hands, two forearms, two shoulders, two thighs, two shins, and two feet. If there is a tie, then team captains will square off on a one on one battle. Some special rules that should also be known is that no teammate can be returned even if you catch a ball and still have all your body parts, unless it is a shot to the to head. Head shot is an automatic kill."

			"in balloon Tag, the court will be triangular. each side of the triangle will be 15 metres long. the court will look sort of like a pyramid. the aim of this sport is to collect as many balloons as you can from the other team. this game lasts for 10 minutes then which the number of balloons obtained is counted and a winner emerges. a team is made up of 6 players and just like flag football, they will wear a belt that carries balloons not flags. the aim is for someone to remove the balloon off your belt and attach it to theirs. players have to continuously teal the other teams balloon before 10 minutes is over. each member of the team will start with 2 balloons and so 12 balloons in total will be given to each team. if at any time you have only one balloon on your belt and you get tapped\/tagged by someone, you have to remain in that position and if for any reason your other balloon gets taken away you leave the game. when a player is stuck, the only way they can start moving again is when one member of their team gives them another balloon. this game will be played in the muddy triangular court."

			"Circle spin is a game that comprises of 10 players; 5 on each team and 2 goalkeepers, one for each team, a ball and 12 hula hoops for each player and the goal keeper. the aim of this sport is to try and score a goal while hula hooping. its just like football, the same rules apply but the difference is that unless you are hula hooping, you cannot move. if you are will the ball and your hula hoop should fall down on the ground, then the other team gets the ball. however, if your hula hoop should fall down after passing the ball, then there is no consequence. ther ball is a lot bigger than a football, its about the size of a men's basketball. this is a co-ed sport and the team should comprise of a minimum of 2 women and 2 men, the 5th player and the goalkeeper can either be a woman or a man. if a shot if fired at the goal keeper, the only way that the goalkeeper can justifiably stop the ball from entering the net is by hula hooping, if he\/she isnt hula hooping and they should attempt to stop the ball, it one point for the opposing team. this is a 30 minute game with a break or 5 minute in between. the winner is the team with the highest score"

Also their can a be a group of people that have a flashlight that has to go looking for the \"ninjas\". If the ninjas are caught by any light people then they are out. The time limit can be set to like 10 minutes so that the game can be quick rather then having to search for ninjas all night."

From there they can start the run and try to navigate through the maze. If they get caught in one of the boobie traps they are out, and the first person that makes it out first wins, while the others get trapped inside the pryamid."

At the top of the tree their will be a small platform which will contain a limited amount of para-gliders that the first few players that make it to the top first can use to fly down. The whole time during the race the tree is being cut down so its basically a race against time to get to the few para gliders first."
