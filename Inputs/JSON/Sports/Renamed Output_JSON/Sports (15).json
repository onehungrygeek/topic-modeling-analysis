				"There would be two teams similar to what you would see in volleyball. There would also be a new in the center of the pool that would reach the bottom of the pool, ensuring that the opposing team does not cross over sides. The objective would be to hit a ball over the net without the opposing team hitting back. Basically, like volleyball. However, there would be a catch. Instead of one ball, there would be two. Instead of hitting the ball, you would catch it. When catching it, you must pass the ball to one of your team members. When catching the ball, you must wait at least one time to catch the ball again, another person must take your place or else the opposing team scores. The ball would sink slowly if it was not caught rather than floating. When this happens, you have five seconds to get the ball and re-serve it, otherwise the opposing team scores. The first team to reach 60 points wins, each score counts as 3 points. When one team scores, the other team has 1 point deducted."

Each button is timed, but too far for a player to press and run to the door, it requires two players to get through."
