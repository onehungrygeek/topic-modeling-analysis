Quality; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)\u00a0 must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.\u00a0 I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have. \u00a0 \u00a0",
