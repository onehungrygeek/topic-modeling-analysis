After reading everyone's ideas it's obvious that what we need is education on health/healthcare system, even distribution of money in FAIR ways to both the people receiving care and the hospitals/staff running these procedures, and to somehow get the rich to be more considerate of the poor. In the end it's hard to say that these are at all possible to achieve (with there being so many people in the world). Maybe education on the subject could spark the fire.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

279,0,"I believe sick people should be treated at a doctors office so they could take up less room in the emergency room so the people with broken bones, severe chest pains, and serious stuff besides a cold or flu or whatever can be treated quicker.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

1812,0,"Emergency room services already have a priority system as it is, but I think that there should be an acute ER as well because when someone comes in with a head injury (possible concussion) or a fever...they're left there for a good 15-30 minutes because it may not seem like an emergency at the moment. Don't let a trauma 1 victim come in, because then everyone will be pushed back.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

I think there should be some way that they are able to get the assistance they need.,"doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1815,0,I love the idea that more places are transitioning to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) because it helps keep records more secure. I worked/volunteered at an office and I was able to just widely see the patient's information when I was putting paper work in. The only downside is the reliability of technology when computers act up at times.,"doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1804,0,"Refusal of healthcare is tricky because once someone refuses healthcare, say if they got in a car accident, the unknown trauma can effect them later.

1368,0,I was watching this show where the hospital was switching over to a new health care procedure when admitting patients to the ER. What i say was they were only allowed  an allotted time with the doctor/patient interaction and there was a script for protocol.The doctors felt like there wasn't enough time to thoroughly asses the patient and to for some type of contact to really understand the problem. With all that being said it could be where the healthcare system is going .,"doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

1755,0,"A government watch on the healthcare system would be nice. I don't belive that their is an actuall government entity that looks over healthcare in general. I know the FDA does oversee it somewhat, but i believe that section is the only part where government can't step in, just in case it goes south, or they're doing something illegal.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

1124,0,"Health care professionals should be on a rating system nationwide to ensure professionalism when dealing with patients. This could be online, like a ""ratemyprofessor"" type system which rates on several aspects of the professional. This way patients can look up their doctors online before choosing them, and automatically the standard for quality care will increase because of demand.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1761,0,"I also say give more responsibilties to nurses. Let them take control sometimes, just as long as their properly trained. I know most nurses with an MBA can pretty much do everything doctors can do, except prescribe medicine.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1126,0,tax the wealthy (350k annual income) at a 5% increase to reduce costs of simple procedures only,"doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
366,0,"this would not be quicker. it would be more stressful for doctors and nurses, and they would be in such a rush to get to every patient that they could miss minor details in a persons health that could be deadly.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

1130,0,"Also, similar to a ""ratemyprofessor"" website/system, there could be a national website similar to ""webmd.com"" in which one can check their symptoms and assess whether a doctor's visit is necessary to cut down on costs. The information being provided for the website will be accurate so as to narrow down other information that could conflict when searching for medical symptoms on the internet.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

1769,0,"yes this is true, nurses tend to have years of knowledge and prep for this kind of work","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1770,0,"More medical professional training. With the competitive and limited nature of nursing school, it becomes discouraging for those interested. If more and more nursing schools appeared, there would be more medical professionals as it pertains to nursing which would increase the volume. At the same time, that would cost more for people to stay, but with the principles of supply and demand, the more people that come in the hospital (not run away from the long emergency room lines) the less we'd have to pay for healthcare.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
350,0,A diverse environment inside hospitals would help people be more accepting with other races. It would help patients be friendly to people they have never interacted with.,"doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

343,0,"Almost everyone has iphone or ipads or technology of some sort. They could use these technologies to help them have a healthy lifestyle.

This could really help many from less hospitals visits.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"
1774,0,"We need to push more Nurse practitioners/Physician assistants before we push cheaper medical school. That is just how it is. Nurse practitioners do almost as much as a doctor would, yet it costs less to the hospital. The military healthcare system is shifting more towards to NP/PA route rather than doctors just due to the cost factor. It's cheaper to the hospital yet the NP/PA's get PAID.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

Doctor's usually only get to see their patient once in situations where they diagnose, therefore they pass out prescriptions as a precautionary measure instead of actually reasoning if the patient truly needs the prescription. There needs to be discrete testing (i.e. personality tests or motor skills testing) that could be done in the waiting room or online before an appointment so the doctor can assess the results and have a better understanding of the patients true psychological, mental, or physical well-being before they're forced to diagnose the patient in one sitting.","doctor, patient, system, good, people, nurse, reduce, disease, visit, work"

Most doctors will suggest lipo-suction, body wraps, or weight loss pills. But has a doctor ever prescribed a healthy meal plan, or a work out schedule? Of course not! America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it.

163,0,"The health care system was built around helping your neighbor in a sense. In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education.

Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.","healthcare, make, time, hospital, people, problem, person, give, technology, emergency_room"

This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay.

OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health.

If students/citizens had a clearer grasp on basic medical conditions/treatments, health care services would be relied on less as a crutch.

It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news.
