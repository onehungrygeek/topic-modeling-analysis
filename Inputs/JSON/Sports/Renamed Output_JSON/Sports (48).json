			"What type of ball would be used for this sport? I think the best type of ball would be something between a soccer and volleyball. Must be sturdy enough to deal with the kicks, but soft enough to not hurt the arms. The goal would be something between a goal and the members of the other team not being able to reach the ball in time. The referee must use his judgement to determine this. Also, physical contact between members of opposing teams should be allowed, I'm not talking about straight up punching someone for the ball, but distracting someone, taking the ball away from them, slightly bumping into them, should all be okay and not considered fouls. This will make the members of the teams think of strategies and will make every team different from one another because while one of the teams may be very physical in order to score, other teams may be very precise in their thinking and clean in order to score. This will make for the good vs evil concept that most fans have towards different teams, always thinking that their team is the best one, even when they lose miserably."

The incentive to keep going for everyone who was in the hunger games was the fear of dying and the hope of living. We have to give them a fear of something and a hope of something else.
