			"The concept of this sport is a mixture of rugby and basketball yet the ring of the goals are vertical and there are three of them. The ball use in this sport is exactly like a rugby ball yet smaller. The rings of the goals are about 20\" wide and stand staggered next to one another on a field the is roughly 40x70 ft. Each ring is worth a different amount of points. The tallest one is 3 points, the middle is 2 points, and the lowest ring is 1 point. You will start the game of with six players on each team. There will be one person who can guard the rings and the other players can be placed strategically as needed (may use a basketball concept going by height). The way players start off will be to have an official punt the pigskin in the air slightly above their heads as they are standing in a circle. The circle will be set up with one player from team 1 and then a person from team 2 and so on until the ten players makes a circle. When traveling with the ball, the player can only have three steps and then must give up the ball (no dribbling). Once the ball is passed to another team mate, it can not be returned to the player that have given it to you unless there was an interception, then you can start over. The object of the game is to get the ball into the rings by defeating the keeper. The keeper can only stay in the circle around the rings which is about 6ft in circumference. The players can put the ball through either side of the rings. The players can only be called on for a foul inside the keepers circle. When a player is foul, 2 shots can be taken at the end of the ring and is only one point regardless of the ring it goes through (keeper is allowed to defend). If scored, take back to middle and repeat the beginning of game, otherwise keeper and can throw the ball out to player. Keepers cannot be taken out that will be a 2 min sit out of the player who did it. Games end after 2- 25 min halves. If the there is a tie, there will be a shoot out. Three players from each team will shoot on the opposing keeper. If tie is not broken continue with the fourth player and so on.."
