			"My second idea for a sport is for that of an individual. It would have to be something completely extreme. It could be something like a triathlon which includes cycling, running, and swimming. Instead of this we could change it up some to be more challenging. On the run there could be more obstacles. Kind of in comparison to a steeplechase. The athletes could run through pits of mud and water and maybe even fire. Along the cycling portion of the triathlon the athletes could come to interference with rugged terrain instead of simply cycling on pavement. Through the swimming portion I can't really think of anything extreme that they could go through, but thats the general idea. We could make the course even longer maybe? or probably shorter since triathlons are pretty long"

			"A new sport that could be made is combining main sports into one sport. (at least the ones that are big here in the U.S.) We could have a sport that involved the volleyball, softball, baseball, soccer, basketball, and football concepts and rules. Luckily some of the sports intertwine with each other already such as basketball and soccer or softball and baseball. The sport would be played on a football field and have a soccer goal post and basketball net on each end zone. We would also have a volleyball net in the middle of the field where the game is started (just like basketball and soccer.) We would start off playing volleyball except instead of serving it and trying to get to 21 points, we would serve it once (a coin toss would determine who got to serve for the first half) and whoever got the point would then be able to attack the goal and basketball hoop. In order to get a point, we would have to shoot the ball with our hands and make it into the hoop and then with our feet BEFORE THE BALL IS DROPPED ON THE GROUND and kick the ball in the net. If a point is made you would then try for the extra point by kicking a field goal. Of course we could use other sports concepts and combine them into this sport to make it more difficult and\/or more fun."
