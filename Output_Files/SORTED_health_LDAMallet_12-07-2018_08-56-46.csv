America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it.

Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy."

The very first thing we need to look at is, if we want good care, we need to take care of those providing us. Somehow more money needs to find its way to these hard working people if not money some kind of compensation for working those ridiculous hours and working as hard as they do.

Americans complain and complain they had a 100 dollar co-pay. Why are you complaining, the meds cost a heck of a lot more to research, develop, get a approved... hell im not going to explain the business process here, you get it.

Forcing every American to buy insurance, lying by saying that the penalties of not doing so is a tax. You can read the health care plan after it is passed???? This is terrifying, that the average American will stand for this, and reelect the same individuals responsible, and their excuse, "" Well at least they are trying"". 40% of americans are on some form of government assistance, and the president keeps saying that things are getting better, and more and more americans are out of work, many illegals receive free healthcare, while not paying taxes.

1817,4,41.43 %,"healthcare, system, free, problem, disease, receive, country, america, provider, find","Affordability, quality and accessibility are some of the characteristics of a good healthcare system. Quality;          Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.  I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have."

163,4,19.68 %,"healthcare, system, free, problem, disease, receive, country, america, provider, find","The health care system was built around helping your neighbor in a sense. In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education. Education would help reduce the work load through people going to where they are suppose to go for a given emergency, not to mention them themselves eating healthier, treating themselves better, etc..."

Sweden, if you are a born citizen, you get to go to college for free. this is how it should be here in America. with a smarter population, health care would take care of itself. people would be able to afford their own health care. also we might become a top country once again. i still think their needs to be competition into what college a person attends though, otherwise college would be like high school, just a right of passage."

OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care."

I look out my family and nation before any other, and taking away some benefits from myself and my family and giving them to others who have no right to them is just wrong, at least without my consent."

All of those nations have healthcare, and sterling economies. Treatment for certain conditions like cancer, for example, are difficult to overcome even with large paychecks. The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. No one in the 21st century, living in the world's most affluent nation, should be denied access to healthcare. Tax rates may increase slightly, but it will be for the overall betterment of society."
