0,0,98.81 %,"emergency, doctor, visit, drug, free, physician, medication, check, health, patient","I think that emergency room visits should be free, if the emergency is one of actual concern. Not an ""emergency"" involving a headache or stomach problems that could be solved with over the counter medication, but rather emergencies involving deep cuts or severe infections."
1,1,99.72 %,"health, people, healthcare, life, care, system, problem, time, related, physical","Another thing, I would like to mention from the previous post, they are: To the Disable people, HIV/AIDS patients, etc. serious diseases, they must to be treated fairly and appropriate to the normal people, or may be better than those because they are even weaker and depress for along time may be the whole life even with mental, physical, or social health. To the LGBT community, they also needs to be treated equally to other people regardless race, age, background, etc. And this is the task of the health care providers who are responsible in providing them the best quality health service. People who is in the Nursing home would be suffered so many problems and can't get away from aging, so they need to have a good care even about mental, physical, and social health treatment to make them enjoy the rest of life. It should be more health care show or programs as many health issue commercials to everyone to make an announcement or warning about any thing related to health like overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, STDs, HIV thread, etc. There are now many and many case of rape related in the healthcare system, so it needs to pass a law or some restriction rules to reduce this issue as guaranteed the good working environment to all healthcare employees."
2,2,98.47 %,"people, health, drug, money, not, will, doctor, time, system, pay","True, so they won't be wasting money on false diagnoses. This would also make the system more reliable to the public, knowing that doctors have to stay current with the diseases and their symptoms."
3,3,99.81 %,"people, care, health, doctor, service, physician, patient, family, afford, time","The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care."
4,4,98.77 %,"people, physician, illness, health, specialist, money, drug, reasonable, doctor, patient",Physicians should be monitored on what and how much they are prescribing to their patients because this may crack down on them getting certain drugs for promotional purposes and receiving things from the drug companies that they would normally not get if they were not prescribing these drugs. It is all about the money in these cases so some doctors really are not considered with their patients health.
