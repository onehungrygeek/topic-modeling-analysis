The team can chose on having from two to four members on the filed. The teams will use three balls to score against the opponent.  Players must use all the balls, one point will be deducted and given to the opponent if all three balls aren't used. Players can use any means to throw the balls and score on their behalf. The use of strategies the team uses will be the base for winning the game."

				"My new sport idea revolves around a circular arena with a 8 ft basket in the middle. There are four players on each team and each team takes a turn running offense and defense. The game will be initiated with the offensive players standing by on the circumference of this circle and when a horn blows they will proceed to try to score in the middle basket. The offensive objective will be to get a ball and score it in the basket. The offense can accomplish this by passing it to the other teammates and running a strategical method to circumvent the defense. The defense, has one goalee protecting the center basket and the other players trying to defend against the offensive team."

				"This game will consist of five 5 minute rounds where the teams take turns on offense and defense. The game will be scored in sets so for example, in round 1 if team A on offense scores 5 points and team B scores 1 point, team A will be awarded 1 point total and then a new round will determine who gets the next point. So next round if team B gets 1 point and team A gets 0 points, then the game is tied even though team A has totaled more points overall. In case of a tie in a round, the game will proceed to the next round with each team being awarded no points. At the end of the game if the score is tied, then the winner will be determined by respective points totaled by each team."

			"The sport is similar to kickball in that there are four bases, a pitcher, and a ball being rolled to the kicker on the opposing team by the pitcher.  However, unlike kickball in order to get someone out you have to hit them with the ball instead of throwing it a man on base.  You can do this to any person on the opposing team whether he\/she is on base or not just as long as they have kicked the ball and have not scored yet. You can also get a player out by catching the ball after it has been kicked, but if the ball hits the wall and you catch it then it is not an out. The ball used in the sport can be a volleyball or soccer ball (they both are easily kick-able) and it is played with 7 players on each team.

Anybody on defense can beg a runner with a ball, it doesn't have to be the pitcher.  The game is played in a gymnasium with a basketball hoop on either side. If the kicker manages to make the ball through the goal he must take off his shirt, and scream while sprinting around the bases.  It is also 3 points.  The defense can also at any time try and punt the ball into the other goal (right by home plate) but it must be from at least 60 feet away.  If successful it would be counted as an out and 1 point.  There should be either a clear wall or metal fence between the action and the bleachers so fans do not get hit with the ball. You cannot tackle another player but it is okay to peg the person with the ball no matter how close they are to you.  Head shots are discouraged but allowed.  Teams are allowed a coach but it is not required.  Your team is allowed 2 timeouts."

			"A good way to make this fun would be to put in a scoring objective somewhere in center pool. The people in the pool do not have the opportunity to score unless they are outside the pool and on the field. In order to get out of the pool and be able to score points for yourself, the dodge balls that are in the pool as a result of the offensive player's objective to score will be used by the pool players to try to tag the outside offensive players(as they try to score). So if the offensive player gets tagged by a dodge ball by a pool player, they essentially trade places and then the pool player gets out of the pool and has the opportunity to score (again, the scoring objective is in the pool somewhere).  Essentially, the offensive field players need proximity to the pool in order to score and the pool players utilize this proximity to tag that player out to get an opportunity to score for themselves. In the aspect of fairness, there should be equal opportunity for each (pool players and field players) to score. So, players who started out on the field in round 1 have to start in the pool in round 2."

The players could use a frisbee shaped object as their ball so that way it could float somewhat. The frisbee could also include a hovering feature, just in case it was dropped the ref could enable the hovering feature to keep the frisbee at the level of the game."

			"The three balls are all different sizes. They range from very small (like a racquet ball), medium (like a soft ball), and large (like a beach ball). The sizes would indicate what types of ways the players can get the balls down the field. The smallest ball would have to be balanced on someones head or hand. The medium size ball would have to be passed by being tossed. And the large ball would have to be passed by being kicked. Each ball would also earn different point values. The smallest ball would earn the most points, then the medium ball, and finally the large ball would earn the least amount of points. The teams could strategize to try and get the smallest ball down the field without the other team knowing where it was."

			"The sport is similar to kickball in that there are four bases, a pitcher, and a ball being rolled to the kicker on the opposing team by the pitcher.  However, unlike kickball in order to get someone out you have to hit them with the ball instead of throwing it a man on base.  You can do this to any person on the opposing team whether he\/she is on base or not just as long as they have kicked the ball and have not scored yet. You can also get a player out by catching the ball after it has been kicked, but if the ball hits the wall and you catch it then it is not an out. The ball used in the sport can be a volleyball or soccer ball (they both are easily kick-able) and it is played with 7 players on each team.  You must get four outs before your team can go back on offense.  The time constraints for the game is 45 minutes not split up into quarters, halves, or periods.  Just straight through.  Anybody on defense can beg a runner with a ball, it doesn't have to be the pitcher.  The game is played in a gymnasium with a basketball hoop on either side. If the kicker manages to make the ball through the goal he must take off his shirt, and scream while sprinting around the bases.  It is also 3 points.  The defense can also at any time try and punt the ball into the other goal (right by home plate) but it must be from at least 60 feet away.  If successful it would be counted as an out and 1 point.  There should be either a clear wall or metal fence between the action and the bleachers so fans do not get hit with the ball. You cannot tackle another player but it is okay to peg the person with the ball no matter how close they are to you.  Head shots are discouraged but allowed.  Teams are allowed a coach but it is not required.  Your team is allowed 2 timeouts."
