			"My sport is called kick-the-can, but, instead of a can, it's a soccer ball. 2 teams of 5 members will go to an area where there are lots of places to hide at. Think of hide and go seek, but there's a little more to it. The teams will flip a coin to see who's \"it\" or not. Whichever team is it, has to pick one member of their team to be the seeker. Once the seeker of the it team is chosen and both teams are ready to play, the ball will be kicked by the hiding team from its designated spot, leaving the seeker to go chase it down, and bring it back to the designated spot. While the seeker is chasing after the ball, the hiding team goes and hides (think of it as hiding while the guy counting has his head turned) the seeker then goes and looks for the hiders. If a hider is spotted, the seeker yells out the name, and location of where he saw the hider. After that's been said, both the seeker and hider run to the ball. The seeker's objective is to touch the ball. If the seeker touches the ball, the hider is out. The hider's objective is to kick the ball back out of the designated area to restart play. This goes on until everyone is caught, or the ball has been kicked 5 times."

			"In this sport their will be three rings on each end of a large grass field. The outer rings will be worth 10 points, while the middle ring will be worth 15. Although the middle ring will be smaller and lower to the ground than the outer rings. Each team will have 7 players on the field at a given time. The ball will be 1 pound and can be kicked or thrown. Their are no penalties for movement. A player may tackle or disrupt another player only if he\/she has the ball in their possession. substitutions may be made at any time but a player must leave the field before a player may enter the field of play. Upon a goal being scored the ball is taken back to the middle and a faceoff will ensue. If a ball goes outside of the field of play then it switches possession to the opposing team. A game will be played to 100 points. A goal scored in the middle ring is worth 25 while a goal scored in the outer rings is worth 10 points."

The first team to find the object wins. Players are not allowed to tamper with another divers equipment as this could endanger the life of a person. Each team member will be given a clue and a flashlight to aid them in their search for the object. A coach will receive various clues throughout the contest which he can relay to his divers. The divers will be tracked throughout the contest and their locations will be displayed back to their coaches. A game will continue as long as it takes to find the object. If a diver's air runs out or needs to replace any equipment he may come back up to the surface and change tanks but it penalized for 15 minutes."
