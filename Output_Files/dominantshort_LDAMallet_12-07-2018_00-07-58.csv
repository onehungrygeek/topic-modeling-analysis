0,0,27.42 %,"people, disease, illness, afford, issue, thing, make, save, mental, sick","Yes, but not all people are like what you say. As I know there are so many people who are very lazy and dependence, but there are also people who get really sick and serious illness that they can not afford by themselves to pay for the medication as well as other health issues"
1,1,27.52 %,"doctor, physician, specialist, money, visit, free, medicine, reasonable, check, medicare","Being able to visit specialists with reasonable prices will also help in the long run--illness could improve or caught early before worsens, and less trips to a physician who could possibly not know what is wrong"
2,2,40.12 %,"health, care, system, time, service, insurance, healthcare, family, give, good","The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care."

4,4,27.86 %,"drug, patient, medication, prescribe, agree, attention, reduce, monitor, medical, age",Physicians should be monitored on what and how much they are prescribing to their patients because this may crack down on them getting certain drugs for promotional purposes and receiving things from the drug companies that they would normally not get if they were not prescribing these drugs. It is all about the money in these cases so some doctors really are not considered with their patients health.
