			"This sport is kind of a three parter. It's basically a test of a players strength, speed, and intellect. The sport is only one on one, no teams, no partners, nothing like that. The first part of the sport is similar to a boxing match. The two competitors will be placed in a boxing ring armed only with a pair of boxing gloves and will be instructed to fight until one of the competitors surrenders, or until 30 minutes (or however many minutes the players agree upon before starting) passes. If the time is up before anyone surrenders then it part one is considered a tie. If someone surrenders before the time passes then the victor is awarded one point. After part one they both move on to part two, which is a sprint. The sprint can either be won by running a certain amount of distance before your opponent, or by seeing who is able to run the farthest in a 30 minute period. The method of winning will be decided by the players before the sprint begins. The victor will receive one point. In case of a tie, neither party will receive points. The final part will take place after a small ten minute rest. Part three will test the ability of the atheletes to complete a puzzle before their competitor. The victor will be the person that finishes their puzzle first, thus providing very little possibility for a tie. The winner is awarded one point. The overall victor for the sport is determined by whoever has the most points by the end of the game. In case of a tie, everybody goes home disappointed."

If a car gets shot enough then it can no longer move and the person driving it can no longer shoot his laser gun. If the game ends up with just two people left and one of them immobilizes the other, the team of the person still moving wins automatically, regardless of the position of the puck.
