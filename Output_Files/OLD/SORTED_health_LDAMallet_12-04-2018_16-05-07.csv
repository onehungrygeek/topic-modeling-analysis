1579,0,"But who should stripe me of this thought, and on what grounds? I feel that a group of people who have paid in, and are our elders, they need to be taken care of, not thrown by the wayside. I think that the bigger issue is that as a nation we are straying away from who we are. Granted I am thinking with my heart, but in the end it is for better not worse. Communism seems to be such a beautiful thing, common sense applied, pure perfection, but the one rule which it does not take into account? We as humans are not perfect. We cannot have a Utopia, it is against our nature.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1648,0,"What is a free clinic? You mean walk-in clinic/minor emergency clinics? Your idea is a good point. A good way to fix the wait time is to give higher pay for general practitioners. Most doctors specialize because they get paid so much more, but minor emergency clinics just use general doctors.

1196,0,Medicine should be available to everyone.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1687,0,"Educating the masses in a variety of areas of health care, especially the ones who are prone to make injunctions of their own health as well as potentially harming others around them, could save a lot of money. Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1689,0,I think EDUCATION on preventive methods to illness would help significantly. So many of the common diseases or conditions are self inflicted and avoidable. I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism at 22 and without knowing at the time what was wrong I thought I was dying. It took me going to an OBGYN ( thinking I have cervical Cancer) to find out that my hormones were out of wack. They immediately wanted to put me on the most expensive medication they could find ( which had a whole laundry list of side affects itself). With a little digging i found that a little exersice and healthy eating would naturally turn my condition around.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"

1683,0,Doctors should have to pass a handwriting test prior to them being allowed to write prescriptions.  That could prevent thousands of mistakes and lives being lost,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1169,0,They should do a drug test or background check on everyone before prescribing them medicine. They need to come up with a shot that can be used instead of pain medicine for all of the people that failed. That way the doctors can still give them pain medicine but it cannot be abused.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
757,0,"Make it difficult for doctors to screw up. They are still people, and of course you want your life to be saved, but mistakes can happen, but if there's a way to limit those mistakes, let's do that.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"

They could do this with commercials, magazines, newspapers, radio, etc.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
238,0,"I honestly don't know, we need to start educating americans at an early age that drugs aren't the solution to every medical problem. That taking to much drugs can lead to other medical issues.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1152,0,"Agreed. A free drug test. If that drug test is failed, then they would have to wait an entire year to be able to apply for annual healthcare again. If the drug test is passed, then the first screening should be free.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1732,0,If the children were smarter about healthy lifestyles then there would be less unnecessary doctor visits which waste time and money and be less at risk for disease and accidents and we would be able to spend that money on those who need it.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1733,0,"They make bigger hospitals for that reason. What should be done is emergency response teams should be able to make the call as to which hospital to go to before they decide on one place, if the patient is stabilized enough to have the couple of minutes available to do so.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1148,0,This could be done by keeping the patient's insurance information confidential from the nurse by having another person designated for any insurance information/claims.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1147,0,Having more doctors available could help this so that they have the time to really assess a patient instead of running around trying to get to everybody.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1144,0,They should require someone to take a drug test (testing for illegal drugs) to determine whether or not someone is able to receive free/reduced healthcare. Because if they are doing drugs then they don't have good health and obviously don't care if they have good health.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
1710,0,"I agree that technology is advancing faster than education, but on the societal aspect. There is a major gap between those who create the newer and newer technology and the consumers and general population. I think its fine that technology is ahead of education, however the gap should not be as wide as it is and it should not be growing at the same rate.","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"

1213,0,"personal religious beliefs aside, parents who are considering birthing a child who is guaranteed a life of suffering need to be REALLY informed of the testimony of people who have the same disease that are alive.

1210,0,"to increase knowledge of how to self diagnose symptoms, or to prevent sickness, upon leaving a medical office, after a check up, operation, whatever, large books of common sicknesses, their symptoms, and prevention, should be available. just like how telephone companies used to give phone books for free, or included in the payment. if people were more readily informed by a trust worthy source (because you can't always trust the internet), many problems could be avoided. not everyone has access to the internet, but almost everyone can read nowadays. unless this has already been implemented...then nvm","patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"

1200,0,"People should be educated about how to react in emergency situations.

If they medical attention that you need is not as an emergency then you should be willing to let others get treated first.,"patient, time, hospital, problem, drug, medicine, person, technology, give, wait"
552,0,The front desk staff could communicate for effectively with the patients on wait times and things like that so that they wouldn't get so frustrated with how long they have been sitting there. Maybe keep a screen with the waiting line if there is a more important case then it jumps. Have certain colors that identify which is more serious and needs attention sooner rather than later.

1267,0,"Patients are normally frightened by hospitals because of anxiety or past experiences.

One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. ""Baby-Boomers"". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to ""band-aid"" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education.

OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health.

America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it. What a caring doctor should prescribe is a dose of ""lay off on the McDonalds"", work out regularly and choose to be healthy.
