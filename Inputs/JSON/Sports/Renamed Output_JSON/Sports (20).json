Maybe a really tall one at about 13 ft high, another at 10 ft and another at 8ft. The goal to get a ball (I'm imagining something like a dodge ball) and throw it through one of hoops. The hoops will have different amounts of points, such as 3 for the highest one, 2 for the medium, and 1 for the shortest. There is no goalie, just a defense and offense position. If a player's sash is torn off, the player must throw the ball straight in the air for a free for all take, and the play has to put his sash back on right after to continue in the game. No tackling, or wrestling to prevent injuries, and a violation will result in their team member having to \"freeze\" and stay in the same spot for for about 5 seconds."
