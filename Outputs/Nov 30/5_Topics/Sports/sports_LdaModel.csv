84,2,okay so I am a really big basketball fan so we can maybe create a sport that is similar to that!,"team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
85,2,"We can have a ball and the offender is only allowed 4 movements and they have to either shoot from there or pass the ball but only two passes is allowed. So say you have one player throw the ball in, most of the time they throw it to the point guard so then point guard makes 4 movements toward the goal. They then have to stop and either shoot it from where they are or pass the ball. this is kind of stupid but I'm trying (this is a really hard thing to do). okay so when the point guard or whoever rebounded the ball in, passes the ball that offender only can make 4 movements. They then can choose to shoot.. or pass but this is their last pass. so kind of like freeze tag basketball ... or like maybe they can have like a buzzer sound so scratch what I said and like they can move however much they want (but they can't pass the ball) until a buzzer (it has to be randomized to eliminate bias)","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

89,1,i think we should try to find a way to combine football and basketball,"would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"
90,2,The person with the ball shouldn't be able to move. maybe have some kind of passing regulations -- like you can't pass the ball to the same person in a row and you can only pass to same person after you pass it to everyone else on the team. everyone participates and no one is left out. and since the other team may know who you'll pass to if it's down to 1 or 2 people it makes it more challenging.,"team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
91,1,"Maybe limit the amount to around 10, because you don't want the field to be filled with people and it would be hard to keep track of who has the ball and who's following regulations or not. Maybe have two umpires with both sides of the field to make sure the rules are intact","would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"
92,2,"Since in harry potter they have hoops to hit the quidditch through, maybe we can have hoops as well with different sizes. The smaller the hoop, the more points you get.

97,2,"With the round table you'll have more space to run around. Maybe do 3 v 3 with this table and same rules with ping pong except you have to feed (serving to) the only one person the entire round instead of alternating. After that people have to alternate hitting the ball (same person can't hit the ball twice in a row, so everyone has to go)","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
98,1,Have a sport kind of like air hockey but in a square so there would be 4 players. Maybe in the middle of the air hockey table there can be some kind of obstacles (similar to pinball) so they'd have to use certain techniques in order to score past certain goals,"would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

103,1,This a good idea but I think you should have some form of stipulations. So like in basketball/football they let you fumble with the ball for a minute and then the refs intervene... so like with the live ball if you can keep it live until someone starts fighting are something then who ever is in possession gets it!,"would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

105,2,"Like one of those blow-up balls that you play with in the pool. it can be like a soccer, volleyball, basketball mix type sport and the opposing team can't cross a certain line... and if the ball goes in the opposing team goal then they score (it would be really cool if there was no designated goally) then you can like add a little fun so like add freeze or something like that so if the music stop playing then the opposing team has to stop what they're doing and give the team 1 chance to score with no defense,","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

108,1,"this is a great idea. what would the rules of this game be though and where would it be held, in a ocean, pond, pool? The side lines and coaches could be on this boat. each player is in for 5-10 minutes. except the QB he can be in for as long as the tank works. how would you be able to measure yardage. have like floating plastic or something. if you do it in the pool you can have it on the outlining of the pool though.","would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"
109,3,"This is dope too. the things you have to put in consideration is where would you play this at though. like if it is in a football sized pool, the rules(not really the rules but the guidelines you can say) would be different than it being in the ocean or somewhere. The pool can have the yardage on the sidelines, but in the ocean you maybe can have some type of floatation device that calculates the yardage.","make, different, not, would, race, way, obstacle, people, also, good"

144,2,SocBall,"team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
145,2,"This game would be similar to soccer. It would entail 11 people on each team. The idea of the game is to get the ball into the hands of your teammate standing in your designated endzone- much like soccer trying to score a goal in the goal box, except you are trying to get the ball to your teammate in SocBall.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
146,2,"The field is dividing into four sections. The two outer sections are the ""endzones"" and where you will have one player from your team, the goalie. The object of the game is to get the ball to your team's goal in your endzone. Within the endzones, only hands may used. In order for a point to count, the goalie must catch the ball using his/her hands.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
147,2,"The remaining two sections of the field is where the rest of the players on both teams will remain. All players, aside from the goalie, are only to use their feet- similar to soccer. No hands are allowed. The use of hands will result in a ""handball"" and the opposing team will receive a free kick.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
148,2,"The game starts with a kick-off. Each team chooses a side to defend. The ""goalie"" is on the opposite side that you are trying to defend. So you are defending the other teams goalie, because you do not want the other team to pass the ball to the ""goalies"" hands and score a point.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

150,2,"If the ball is directed to the goalie and hits the ground, the endzone is free game for additional players to enter. However, the ball must hit the ground prior to any players crossing over the endzone line. If a player crosses over the endzone line, prior to the play hitting the ground, this will result in a penalty.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

153,2,"Inside the endzone: You cannot score inside of the endzone. If the ball hits the ground and players are allowed into the endzone, the ball must leave the endzone, requiring all players to leave the endzone as well and then re-enter and the goalie must receive the ball in his/her hands for a goal to count.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

156,2,"There is no foul play, pushing or use of elbows. This will result in a foul kick and the opposing team can take the kick where the foul was made. If the foul is questionable by both teams, the referee will perform a ""drop ball"" where two opposing teammates stand face to face with a minimal distance between, and the referee will drop the ball in between the two.

160,1,"I really like this idea. It's got solid faceoff, offside, penalty, and scoring rules already set up. I like the idea of the sectors. I think of the field as kind of like an ellipse that has the two shallow sides being the ""endzones"" and the middle, including the ends, being the large area for the players to be in.  There isn't much I can add to this idea seeing as its already mostly developed, but in terms of playing quality we'll probably have to think up situations to where added rulings are needed.  For instance; to what extent can the goalie move within the endzone, and would there be penalties for the goalie missing the ball in the endzone?  These are just things that we would need to develop as we move along with such an endeavour.","would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

The ball use in this sport is exactly like a rugby ball yet smaller. The rings of the goals are about 20"" wide and stand staggered next to one another on a field the is roughly 40x70 ft. Each ring is worth a different amount of points. The tallest one is 3 points, the middle is 2 points, and the lowest ring is 1 point. You will start the game of with six players on each team. There will be one person who can guard the rings and the other players can be placed strategically as needed (may use a basketball concept going by height). The way players start off will be to have an official punt the pigskin in the air slightly above their heads as they are standing in a circle. The circle will be set up with one player from team 1 and then a person from team 2 and so on until the ten players makes a circle. When traveling with the ball, the player can only have three steps and then must give up the ball (no dribbling). Once the ball is passed to another team mate, it can not be returned to the player that have given it to you unless there was an interception, then you can start over. The object of the game is to get the ball into the rings by defeating the keeper. The keeper can only stay in the circle around the rings which is about 6ft in circumference. The players can put the ball through either side of the rings. The players can only be called on for a foul inside the keepers circle. When a player is foul, 2 shots can be taken at the end of the ring and is only one point regardless of the ring it goes through (keeper is allowed to defend). If scored, take back to middle and repeat the beginning of game, otherwise keeper and can throw the ball out to player. Keepers cannot be taken out that will be a 2 min sit out of the player who did it. Games end after 2- 25 min halves. If the there is a tie, there will be a shoot out.

Whoever finishes first wins. This is like a relay race. There would have to be obstacles set up for each individual. Or, this sport could be done with teams (like you sprint to one point and tag your team member to complete the next sprint and set of obstacles, like that track&field event where you pass the baton). Some other ideas of obstacles could include: crawling under shock wires in the mud, walking on a narrow beam (like a tightrope), climbing up a wall... open to other suggestions.

You know which hole your originally shot your ball in, but the referee/umpire mixes up the 3 cups so that you don't know which one your ball is under. If you guess correctly, you get to keep your points from your hole in one (open to ideas on a scoring/points system), but if you guess incorrectly, you lose all your points (again, contingent on the points/scoring system. so maybe you lose points, maybe you gain a zillion points - which would be bad in a real game of golf - or maybe you get a spanking... open to ideas here).

Also, implement a time threat. Where if one team does not get the ball across the half way point of the field it would be considered a ""back court"" and a turnover.

899,2,i really like this idea it seems  really fun and making the game be played in an indoor closed court would make it a lot more fun because it causes the players to use whats around them (the wall) and it allows the player to think more and come up with strategies to get the ball in the up.,"team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

Kind of in comparison to a steeplechase. The athletes could run through pits of mud and water and maybe even fire. Along the cycling portion of the triathlon the athletes could come to interference with rugged terrain instead of simply cycling on pavement.

The sport would be played on a football field and have a soccer goal post and basketball net on each end zone. We would also have a volleyball net in the middle of the field where the game is started (just like basketball and soccer.) We would start off playing volleyball except instead of serving it and trying to get to 21 points, we would serve it once (a coin toss would determine who got to serve for the first half) and whoever got the point would then be able to attack the goal and basketball hoop. In order to get a point, we would have to shoot the ball with our hands and make it into the hoop and then with our feet BEFORE THE BALL IS DROPPED ON THE GROUND and kick the ball in the net.

There should be about 6-7 players on each team. There could be women, men, and coed leagues.

1239,2,What would make this even more challenging is getting the team to take the ball down the field or court or whatever by passing the ball back and forth only using their heads.

The hoops will have different amounts of points, such as 3 for the highest one, 2 for the medium, and 1 for the shortest. There is no goalie, just a defense and offense position. If a player's sash is torn off, the player must throw the ball straight in the air for a free for all take, and the play has to put his sash back on right after to continue in the game.

They can us their feet or hand, but whatever they use, they have to hold on the rings with that section of the body.

If three people get out then it's another teams turn to go up against the lion. After 6 innings who ever has the most points wins the game.

The two competitors will be placed in a boxing ring armed only with a pair of boxing gloves and will be instructed to fight until one of the competitors surrenders, or until 30 minutes (or however many minutes the players agree upon before starting) passes. If the time is up before anyone surrenders then it part one is considered a tie. If someone surrenders before the time passes then the victor is awarded one point. After part one they both move on to part two, which is a sprint. The sprint can either be won by running a certain amount of distance before your opponent, or by seeing who is able to run the farthest in a 30 minute period. The method of winning will be decided by the players before the sprint begins. The victor will receive one point. In case of a tie, neither party will receive points. The final part will take place after a small ten minute rest. Part three will test the ability of the atheletes to complete a puzzle before their competitor. The victor will be the person that finishes their puzzle first, thus providing very little possibility for a tie. The winner is awarded one point.

BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE TRAINED FOR YEARS and train their animals for years and preferably have them grow up together so that way the animal is emotionally attached to its owner and won't have the urge to eat them. So they would start on a track, but instead of one of those rough tracks like the horses, this track would be made out of hardened mud for the comfort of the paws of the jaguars. If they aren't able to run on tracks (if it's impossible to train a jaguar to do that), maybe have the jaguars run to a certain target and have like a tracker on them while the rider is riding them.

While the seeker is chasing after the ball, the hiding team goes and hides (think of it as hiding while the guy counting has his head turned) the seeker then goes and looks for the hiders. If a hider is spotted, the seeker yells out the name, and location of where he saw the hider. After that's been said, both the seeker and hider run to the ball. The seeker's objective is to touch the ball. If the seeker touches the ball, the hider is out. The hider's objective is to kick the ball back out of the designated area to restart play.

The rules are similar to dodgeball except that instead of throwing it, we can only kick the ball at other people. Rules are simple, if you get hit- you're out. This continues until the opposing team has no more players. Each team starts off with only 3 balls. Unlike dodgeball- catching the opposing team's ball does nothing except eliminate you, however, if you kick a ball that was kicked at you before it touches the ground and it hits a player on the opposing team then the player on the opposing team is eliminated--and if it hits the player who kicked it initially then that person is out and a person on your team who was out can come back in. Also if a ball happens to hit a player in the head or groin then the person who kicked the ball gets a red card and is out indefinitely for the remainder of the game. The game is best out of three rounds so two wins is necessary, players who are penalized for kicking the ball to the head or groin are still punished and cannot join the game for the second and third round.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

Then the ball would have some sort of anti-gravity mechanism that can keep it at a certain level unless a player makes contact with it.  If the player scoops the ball up and throws it, it will fly.  If the player thrusts it down that it will fall down.  But gravity will be minimized by the mechanical ball. The purpose of the game will be to get the ball through a circular goal at a certain dimensional height in the sky.  By using their sticks, hang gliders, and teammates, players will work towards advancing the ball into the goal.  players will start off at a high peak or maybe even off of a plane to where they will then hang glide down and race to the ball where it will be placed in a neutral location for both teams to retrieve.

Also the last person left may not have the most points but maybe if he was to say tie with the person that does then they go to sudden death which would consist of a best out of three light-saber duel for which the rules are quite clear, get struck you lose the round.","person, must, time, win, first, go, flag, balloon, end, give"

At each location players will find a simple riddle that will guide them to their next stop along with a letter.

Players can only get oil in certain spots while playing the game. If you run out of gas before reaching the final location then you are out the game. So players must also be aware of how much gas they are using up and if they can fill it up. There is one thing though: A player can get gas at anytime but they will be penalized by being forced to ""freeze"", which means stop what they are doing, for a certain amount of time. Players must remember they have only 24 hours to finish getting to all the location. So in this game it is possible for none of the players to win the game. Also, apart from everything else mention players do receive a map in the beginning of the game so they can track their path.

2156,2,"I have an idea for a sport called ""Freethrow"".  It starts off with two separate teams of 5 players each.  The two teams go into a rectangular field/court that has a set of rings on either side.  Each side of the field has 3 rings suspended in the air, each at different heights or diameters.  The objective is for a team to throw a boomerang, or some other projectile, through the rings in order to earn points for their team.  Depending on how challenging it is to throw through the ring determines the amount of points a team will receive.  The players must get to their opponent's side of the field by passing the boomerang from one player on a team to another.  This is where it could get a little challenging due to the curved trajectory of the boomerang.  If an opposing player intercepts a pass, he may begin to run to the other side of the field.  Once a team does score, the opposing team starts off with the boomerang and can run to the other side of the field.  The game will be divided into two separate halves.  In between each half, the teams switch sides so that it is fair if there is a problem due to wind blowing in one direction.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

2171,2,"This sport is very similar to the sport we are all familiar with which is soccer. Like soccer, the activity would involve a ball, two teams, and two goals. However, the twist in this sport would be that there would be three balls instead of the single ball we normally see in soccer. Having three balls in the sport would generate more rapidity, and one could view the teams cohesiveness and how they work together when there are more balls in the field. The sport would also increase organization and triple the amount of action that occurs on the field.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

2183,1,"I had a similar idea, in which it was comparable to hockey or something with a stick, or maybe something that can catch and launch a ball.If the game is being played underwater, which is the way I see it, the best current sport for the idea would be football. Instead of a quarterback, the game would have a kind of launcher for a ball, and other players would have to catch it or defend the launcher until he fires his shot. Because a player can't be knocked down underwater per se, the teams would wear flags of some kind to be pulled away to signify that they have to stop, and launch again in order to gain more distance towards the goal.While a launcher isn't perfect, because of the precision allowed by one, it'd be better to make a larger playing field. In football there are also multiple opportunities to make a certain yardage, perhaps in the case of this underwater incarnation, for each failure to make the needed distance, greater difficulty is applied by simulating water currents that make a shot more difficult, giving the defending team a greater chance of intercepting the ball or preventing their opponents from making a catch.","would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

Once the player has returned the ball, he/she must assure that their ""toss"" back to the opponent is within ten feet of net (there would be lines taped/painted on the floor to mark the ten foot range). If the player's toss is past the ten foot range, then the players toss will be considered out of bounds, and the tosser will be eliminated.

Since the tennis ball would accelerate faster off of the tennis racket the field could be bigger. Instead of playing on dirt and grass, the game could be played on turf. Instead of 3 bases and a home plate, there could be 4 bases and 1 home plate. In order to score points you have to make it to each of the bases. The first base could be one point, the second base could be two points. the third base could be three, the fourth could be four, and home plate could be five points. Once you pass that base you receive that amount of points. ,  In order to get out of the inning you would have to get four outs. The game would be played for 5 innings. For example, if a person gets to the third base and the next person is the fourth out, that team would still receive 3 points. There would be a home and visiting team. Since you are just using your hands to throw and catch as well, you would be allowed to peg a runner. If you do so, that runner would be out.

By chance of who ever gets to the ball first. There will be an even number of players on the team because each will have a partner that is similar in size and athletic ability and they will play together to assist one another throughout the entire game.

2285,2,"Next number 2's name tag will be ripped by the number's 3-5 on each team. Until one of the number two is out each team will continue to tackle each other to rip the name tag. If one team rips number 2 they can proceed to ripping number 3. Both teams don't have to be on the same number. The more times you rip the name tags the better because this is how you would get points. When number 5's name tag is ripped, number 1 can go in and it will be continuing like this until 6 minutes. In this time frame whoever finishes with the most points wins. Tackling, running, and fighting is permitted but there can't be anything too violent such as, biting the opponent or pulling hair. The game will be played in a rink about the size of a ice rink or maybe even bigger. The players will wear protective gear. The name tag will be attached on with Velcro. The players can decide the order. It is usually better to place the players who are better or stronger toward the end. This game can be played by both genders but they have to be even. If one team has all girls, the other team must have all girls. If one team has one girl and four guys, the other team must have the same. This isn't recommended. It can also be played with all guys. There will only be two rounds with a total of 12 minutes. In between there will be 15 minute break time. After the break, the game resumes with 6 more minutes but the it starts where it left off. You wouldn't restart with attacking number one. Speed is important since there is a time limit so, if you can rip off a name tag within one minute than you would get an extra point for doing it quickly. The maximum number of extra points you get is 3 points. There will be little round oval on each side of the rink. If you can get the person inside the oval when your are ripping off the name tag you can get an extra 2 points. With maximum of 4 points. There will be one referee and a person to keep track of the points. Ways you can get disqualified are running off the playing field, using excessive violence, carrying a weapon to the playing ground, and cheating.

One member will have a concealable flag that will have to be posted up once it's made to the other side of the field.  If you are hit by the ball then you must drop and stay there while the the other team members try to make it across.  You can also have the choice of running in a formation with the whole team for an automatic win if all make it across safely.

I think it'd be a cool sport if we combined the two, making it like a capture the flag game with water/paint guns.

The teams begin on opposite sides of the football field. The flags are in the middle of the football field. You know you're getting closer to the center because the yard lines will still be available. In order to complete the capture the flag you have to get the flag to the opposite side of the field that you started on. You have the option of not getting your flag but getting everyone on your team to the other side unscathed in under five minutes in order to automatically win the game.

The closer you are the more easy it is to get the other team out.The ball can only be tossed by using throwing the ball through the legs. The ball can be passed to other team members in the group for a better angle of attack. The team who is the last one at least one member of their team wins.

The defense wouldn't be able to grab the ball from the person holding it. For the defense to steal the ball the ball would either have to be deflected, intercepted on a pass, or be thrown away by the team that's on offense (like say team 1 tries to throw to another member on team 1 and the person doesn't catch it, then team 2 would get the ball where the ball was thrown, or something like that! But if team 2 knocks the ball down on a pass, team 1 would still have the ball.) or get the ball after the other team scores in their end zone. It could be continuous play unless stopped by an official. If players are playing dirty or rough they can get certain levels of warnings until they get ejected. There could be a certain amount of timeouts per half (like 1 or 2). Substitutes can be subbed in and subbed during a pause in play.

2648,2,"What type of ball would be used for this sport? I think the best type of ball would be something between a soccer and volleyball. Must be sturdy enough to deal with the kicks, but soft enough to not hurt the arms. The goal would be something between a goal and the members of the other team not being able to reach the ball in time. The referee must use his judgement to determine this. Also, physical contact between members of opposing teams should be allowed, I'm not talking about straight up punching someone for the ball, but distracting someone, taking the ball away from them, slightly bumping into them, should all be okay and not considered fouls. This will make the members of the teams think of strategies and will make every team different from one another because while one of the teams may be very physical in order to score, other teams may be very precise in their thinking and clean in order to score. This will make for the good vs evil concept that most fans have towards different teams, always thinking that their team is the best one, even when they lose miserably.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
2649,1,"Something that would be awesome for this sport would be obstacles they are having to face as a team and overcome as a team as well, such as bicycling in a storm, up a very steep hill, one of their tires randomly giving out. Of course, this sport measures their athletic qualities by making sure they are in sync and meeting their goal at a certain time, but giving them obstacles to overcome such as these will test their mental aptitude for challenges as well as how well they work in teams. A team might be the most physically fit but hate one another, which will cause them to not work well as a team and lose. In contrast, another team might not be the most fit, however their level of communication is impeccable and they end up winning.","would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

However, if we randomly give out rewards such as being able to use their dominant side for a round or for a certain play, this will spice things up and add to the competitiveness. What would also be interesting, would be if every single team member does not know one another personally at all. Within each of these teams, there will be a snake; this team members job is to purposely mess up the team they are on so the other team wins. If the other team wins, they will win a cash prize. Members of each team will know there is a snake in their team; however they will not know who it is. This will cause alliances to be built within the team, and inner conflict with one another.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

That being said, I think there should be certain team members behind the scenes controlling what happens in the environment their team members and other teams' members as well. Food should be an incentive, not saying people should starve, but this will motivate them as well as other prizes. The incentive to keep going for everyone who was in the hunger games was the fear of dying and the hope of living. We have to give them a fear of something and a hope of something else. This will increase the repetitiveness between all members. Also, every week the teams should be changed and mixed up.

The offensive objective will be to get a ball and score it in the basket.

So next round if team B gets 1 point and team A gets 0 points, then the game is tied even though team A has totaled more points overall.

2676,2,"The sport is similar to kickball in that there are four bases, a pitcher, and a ball being rolled to the kicker on the opposing team by the pitcher.  However, unlike kickball in order to get someone out you have to hit them with the ball instead of throwing it a man on base.  You can do this to any person on the opposing team whether he/she is on base or not just as long as they have kicked the ball and have not scored yet. You can also get a player out by catching the ball after it has been kicked, but if the ball hits the wall and you catch it then it is not an out. The ball used in the sport can be a volleyball or soccer ball (they both are easily kick-able) and it is played with 7 players on each team.  You must get four outs before your team can go back on offense.  The time constraints for the game is 45 minutes not split up into quarters, halves, or periods.  Just straight through.  Anybody on defense can beg a runner with a ball, it doesn't have to be the pitcher.  The game is played in a gymnasium with a basketball hoop on either side. If the kicker manages to make the ball through the goal he must take off his shirt, and scream while sprinting around the bases.  It is also 3 points.  The defense can also at any time try and punt the ball into the other goal (right by home plate) but it must be from at least 60 feet away.  If successful it would be counted as an out and 1 point.  There should be either a clear wall or metal fence between the action and the bleachers so fans do not get hit with the ball. You cannot tackle another player but it is okay to peg the person with the ball no matter how close they are to you.  Head shots are discouraged but allowed.

2679,2,"A good way to make this fun would be to put in a scoring objective somewhere in center pool. The people in the pool do not have the opportunity to score unless they are outside the pool and on the field. In order to get out of the pool and be able to score points for yourself, the dodge balls that are in the pool as a result of the offensive player's objective to score will be used by the pool players to try to tag the outside offensive players(as they try to score). So if the offensive player gets tagged by a dodge ball by a pool player, they essentially trade places and then the pool player gets out of the pool and has the opportunity to score (again, the scoring objective is in the pool somewhere).  Essentially, the offensive field players need proximity to the pool in order to score and the pool players utilize this proximity to tag that player out to get an opportunity to score for themselves. In the aspect of fairness, there should be equal opportunity for each (pool players and field players) to score. So, players who started out on the field in round 1 have to start in the pool in round 2.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

There would also be a border as to where the ball would still be considered in play so power shots will still have effect in the game. You may also use any part of your body to hit the ball back as long as it only hits your paddle once. So you may use your chest to stop the ball then hit it back with the paddle or even hit the ball back with your hand if you so choose.

If a ball is intercepted by another team, the team who intercepted the ball automatically gets 1 point.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

2791,2,"Erase Ball: Basically similar to dodge ball where there is a couple of balls placed in the middle of the court with two teams of at least 5 on each side. The objective of the game is to get all the members of the other team out by hitting them with one of the erase balls. However the difference in this game from dodge ball is that if the erase ball makes contact with your body, whichever body part it was will be erased, meaning you no longer can use it. An example would be that if you got hit in your left leg, you would not be able to use it anymore and would have to stand only on your right leg since your left leg was ""erased"". If you got hit in the torso or stomach however, everything from the place you got hit down would be ""erased"". The only way to be able to get back your lost body parts is if you catch a ball. One body part can be replaced back per catch. If you missed the catch however you will lose whatever hand or arm or whatever the part of the body the ball made contact with. Time limit for games is usually ten minutes or Unlimited if you are playing ""fight to the death"" style. The court will be around 20 ft long and each team will stand 10ft away from where the balls are in the middle prior to whistle being blown to start the game. In the ten minute games, crossing the line prior to the 5 min mark result in an automatic erase which means the player is out. However, at the 5 min mark, players may move over 5 ft from the middle to other team territory to gain an advantage. At the 1 min mark, free reign of the whole court is viable and there are no boundaries. Wins can be determined by the number of players completely erased and by the number of body part that are left on a persons body. Major body parts will be counted only. So the head, two hands, two forearms, two shoulders, two thighs, two shins, and two feet. If there is a tie, then team captains will square off on a one on one battle. Some special rules that should also be known is that no teammate can be returned even if you catch a ball and still have all your body parts, unless it is a shot to the to head. Head shot is an automatic kill.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
2792,2,"in balloon Tag, the court will be triangular. each side of the triangle will be 15 metres long. the court will look sort of like a pyramid. the aim of this sport is to collect as many balloons as you can from the other team. this game lasts for 10 minutes then which the number of balloons obtained is counted and a winner emerges. a team is made up of 6 players and just like flag football, they will wear a belt that carries balloons not flags. the aim is for someone to remove the balloon off your belt and attach it to theirs. players have to continuously teal the other teams balloon before 10 minutes is over. each member of the team will start with 2 balloons and so 12 balloons in total will be given to each team. if at any time you have only one balloon on your belt and you get tapped/tagged by someone, you have to remain in that position and if for any reason your other balloon gets taken away you leave the game. when a player is stuck, the only way they can start moving again is when one member of their team gives them another balloon. this game will be played in the muddy triangular court.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

2864,2,"A good sport would be a running backward sport. It would be similar to track and field except the person participating would be backwards. It would take place on a track. There would be different events i.e. 200 m, 100 m, 400 m etc. A person would start at the starting line with their back turned in the direction they will be running. The people participating in the race will run as fast as they can backwards without falling. If a person falls the team can lose a point or be disqualified from the race. The first person to get over the finish line without falling is the winner and his or her team will gain a point.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
2865,2,The sport is very similar to track but with just a few differences. There would even be a relay.

A blind person could throw a frizzbie to his or her's dog and the dog will catch it. The dogs will have to do some type of trick before or after catching the frizzbie. There would be around 4 judges watching the technique the owner uses and the performance the dog gives. Points would be given to each team.

A member is eliminated just like in the original sport of Dodgeball: once they are hit with a ball or their thrown ball is caught by the opposing team. In order to score, at least one member of the team must be carrying the ""colored dodgeball"" across the goal line without having been eliminated. Once a team member crosses the goal line, the team is awarded points and the ball is given to the opposing team for a chance to score.

The opposing team will be able to strategically place themselves anywhere on their half of their field (Between their own goal line and 50 yard line.) Ten of the 14 playing dodgeballs will be divided between the two teams at the start of the possession, while the other 4 will be lined up on the 50 yard goal line, free for anyone to grab at any point of the game. The objective of the team with the colored dodgeball is to cross the opponents goal line. The ""carrier"", (the person who is carrying the ball) can not place the ball on the floor, but he/she can pass it to another team mate. If the ball hits the floor, it is a change a possession and it must be thrown or kicked to the opposing team. Once the opposing team receives the ball, play continues. Players are eliminated when they are struck out with a hit from a dodgeball. If a member catches an opponents ball, a team mate may enter play once again.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"

2891,1,I think a good way to make the sport more challenging would be to have more obstacles. Maybe have some obstacles that the participant has to go through while he or she runs to the hole. Kind of like that show Wipeout where they have all these different obstacles but in the running golf it wouldn't be that harsh because it's a sport and not a game.  Also I think to elaborate on it being a team sport. It can be like a relay. One person can attempt to do X amount of holes and then the next person will have a turn. So it would be a race against other teams to see which team will finish the fastest.,"would, sport, could, water, also, require, able, opponent, winner, certain"

The players could be knowledgeable of the playing field before the game as well, knowing which holes are the harder to hit, which are the easiest, and which holes are the quickest to get to. If a player reaches a hole, the hole is closed to all players until the player who got to the hole first is done. This would add extra strategical factors for the players: Players could potentially have a pre-game planned route to each hole. If a hole is already taken, players would also be faced with a decision to wait for the hole to open up or they could race to another hole to prevent wasting time.","team, ball, player, game, get, point, hit, member, goal, throw"
