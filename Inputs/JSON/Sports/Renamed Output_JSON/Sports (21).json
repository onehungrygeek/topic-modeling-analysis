There would be two people standing at home and when the opposing team counts to 5 the two people at base would have to start running towards first base without being tagged. One player would run to first base, and the other would start to run to third base therefore there wouldn't be any collisions. When it comes to both players running to second no one is safe; even though they are on the base they can still get tagged because rule is two people cant be on the same base at one time. They cant remain on their original bases either because it leaves it open for them to get tagged again because there would be two people on base. The number of players on each team at max is 10. The team that successfully makes it home each the most amount of times wins."

If the person drops the hula hoop that would be counted as an out and would have to go back to the end of the line. If someone is successful at going back and foward that is one point for the team but the other team cant go unless there is three outs marked by that team."

			"I think this should be played on something like a baseball field and each base is the safe cage and the same concept goes if the lion catches you than you are out. I think it would save more time and make it more fun than tiring. Also the people who successfully rounds all the safe cages gains a point for their team. If three people get out then it's another teams turn to go up against the lion. After 6 innings who ever has the most points wins the game. Also the lion would start at the pitcher mound of each game"

I wouldnt change anything about this game because it has a great concept. Since it is a walking game I would have no penalties. People can get the person down any kind of way they want without being penalized."

			"On each team should have one person guarding their ball and the game's objective should be to successfully gain the other team's ball and still maintain your own. If a team is able to maintain keeping their own ball than that team should get double points. If a team's ball is taken but they gain the other team's ball first then they should just get standard points. I think the game should be best 2 out of 3 to prove who is really the winner. Forget the points part just best 2 out of 3."

			"Another idea I would like to contribute is human bowling. This game requires two teams of 6, two scooters, bowling pins, and safety pads\/helmet. NO BALL. A teammate who volunteers them self to be the human ball will be the person on the scooter for all rounds. This game has the same concept as bowling except it should be played in a indoor gym with wood flooring. There will be no bumpers allowed. There will also be a set mark that no one can surpass after rolling the human ball to knock down pins."
