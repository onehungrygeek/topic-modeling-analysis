			"A game that is sort of like baseball, but instead of using bats, balls, and gloves you could use a tennis racket and tennis balls. You would have to be skilled in catching and throwing. Since the tennis ball would accelerate faster off of the tennis racket the field could be bigger. Instead of playing on dirt and grass, the game could be played on turf. Instead of 3 bases and a home plate, there could be 4 bases and 1 home plate. In order to score points you have to make it to each of the bases. The first base could be one point, the second base could be two points. the third base could be three, the fourth could be four, and home plate could be five points. Once you pass that base you receive that amount of points. ,  In order to get out of the inning you would have to get four outs. The game would be played for 5 innings. For example, if a person gets to the third base and the next person is the fourth out, that team would still receive 3 points. There would be a home and visiting team. Since you are just using your hands to throw and catch as well, you would be allowed to peg a runner. If you do so, that runner would be out. On the field, there would be 9 players; a pitcher and a catcher, one player between each base and three outfielders."

Just like in volleyball: two courts with a net in the middle, ball can't hit the ground, unlike volleyball where they hit the ball three times. the team can hit (in this case kick) the ball 5 or less times when the offensive team has the ball. And just like you would play soccer: kicking the ball over the net, hands can't touch the ball, allowed to use your head to hit the ball."

Scoring would go to 16 points for the first two games and 8 for the last game."

			"Next number 2's name tag will be ripped by the number's 3-5 on each team. Until one of the number two is out each team will continue to tackle each other to rip the name tag. If one team rips number 2 they can proceed to ripping number 3. Both teams don't have to be on the same number. The more times you rip the name tags the better because this is how you would get points. When number 5's name tag is ripped, number 1 can go in and it will be continuing like this until 6 minutes. In this time frame whoever finishes with the most points wins. Tackling, running, and fighting is permitted but there can't be anything too violent such as, biting the opponent or pulling hair. The game will be played in a rink about the size of a ice rink or maybe even bigger. The players will wear protective gear. The name tag will be attached on with Velcro. The players can decide the order. It is usually better to place the players who are better or stronger toward the end. This game can be played by both genders but they have to be even. If one team has all girls, the other team must have all girls. If one team has one girl and four guys, the other team must have the same. This isn't recommended. It can also be played with all guys. There will only be two rounds with a total of 12 minutes. In between there will be 15 minute break time. After the break, the game resumes with 6 more minutes but the it starts where it left off. You wouldn't restart with attacking number one. Speed is important since there is a time limit so, if you can rip off a name tag within one minute than you would get an extra point for doing it quickly. The maximum number of extra points you get is 3 points. There will be little round oval on each side of the rink. If you can get the person inside the oval when your are ripping off the name tag you can get an extra 2 points. With maximum of 4 points. There will be one referee and a person to keep track of the points. Ways you can get disqualified are running off the playing field, using excessive violence, carrying a weapon to the playing ground, and cheating. People who are stronger are those who excel in this sport. Players can also wear skates in this sport."
