maybe the ER should also decrease in cost
guns dont kill people, people kill people
hire strictly researchers, instead of someone trying to juggle being a doctor and researching

unless the person is diabetic or has another weight and food intake control issue, they should be held responsible for their actions leading them to this
more portion controlled containers. if there isn't a lot more than what you're supposed to have there, then less people will be coerced into eating more than a serving
and if they arent accountable to the appointments they should be fined for possibly harming themselves which consequently drives healthcare up
states simply cannot support all the healthcare funds without federal support
create punishments for refusing to visit regularly scheduled appointments without notice and rescheduling
also many restaurants should start cutting back on portions size
individual states can act as a guinea pig, but the amount of healthcare for all of a state's citizens would put some states in debt. keep health insurance federal, but allow states to try out different healthcare systems using federal funds

Greater reliance on preventive care
Create a more efficient and sustainable health care provider to assist the needs of low income and uneducated families
Both should be implemented to prevent unhealthy habits and advertise a healthy lifestyle
Much like alcohol, prohibit it during certain times of the week/day.
