			"This sport is a combination of dogged ball and ultimate Frisbee. Two teams of 5 or more. One team is on opposite ends facing each other. The object of the game is to get the opposing team members out using the ball being tossed. The closer you are the more easy it is to get the other team out.The ball can only be tossed by using throwing the ball through the legs. The ball can be passed to other team members in the group for a better angle of attack. The team who is the last one at least one member of their team wins. In order to move to get closer the opposing team must toss the ball to each other or for an attack.  Once the ball stops moving then so does the team members."
