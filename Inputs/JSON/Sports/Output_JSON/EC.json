				"For round One, your group of twenty people will form a circle around each other and put both hands into the middle of the circle. Each and every team member will grab two different people's hands, thus forming a giant knot in the middle. The competition between two teams is to unravel the knots of arms and hands as fast as possible without letting go of anyone's hand. If anyone lets go or releases their persons hand, then their team has to start all over. For round Two, after the arms are unraveled, the teams must then proceed by forming a long vertical line with their legs wide apart, and the person at the back will crawl underneath everyone's legs. Following the next person at the back of the line, and so forth until everyone has crawled underneath each others legs. For the final Round Three, each team member will complete a blow up maze\/obstacle course with items to dodge, crawl under and over, maneuver around, and avoid. This course takes approximately five minutes for the entire team to cross, depending on how fast the team is. The rules for this round is that nobody is allowed to pass their own team member in front of them, and every single team member must cross the finish line to win. Otherwise, you will either have to start all over, or you will lose."
