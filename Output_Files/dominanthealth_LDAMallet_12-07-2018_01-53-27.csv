0,0,39.83 %,"health, care, insurance, cost, government, provide, company, afford, high, family","Adding onto this, I think that employers should provide health care services of some sort to all regular employees. Ideally the government would provide a basic, low-cost health care service to all citizens while employers included better (possibly more advanced/higher coverage) plans in addition to it."
1,1,42.86 %,"doctor, pay, patient, money, time, hospital, service, work, nurse, technology",this seems like a great idea but the app may tend to have glitches and can have technical problems. And also people come and go so not everybody will know that this app exsist and not everyone has a smart phone and has access to this app. the doctors time he spends with his patients varys so he may not always be on time for the next patient thats why there are so many people waiting in the waiting room. everyone has their own clinical problems but if the doctor can at least spend with each patient for 30 minutes it will help with the waiting time for the other patients.
2,2,55.13 %,"school, medical, education, agree, student, educate, emergency, lot, put, class","reform our educational system in a way that once someone enters high school (after their freshman year so they can get a feel for how school is) they are forced to choose whether they want to further pursue a college degree or enter the work force right out of school. After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someoneÂ  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more. For far too long have I seen students in high school being taught math and science they never use in day to day activities when they don't even plan to go to college this education of these subjects to people who choose to enter the workforce waste so much time doing this that they have to wait and have no experience in how to get the jobs and once they do get the job they don't know how to do the required tasks in an adequate manner."
3,3,46.5 %,"people, make, thing, free, drug, medicine, medication, child, start, american","generic brand contain most of the same ingriedents as the original prescription. the reason there are generic brands is because of the obvious that it is cheaper and easier to get access to, as over the counter medications. many drugs are now becoming more afordable because it is over the counter. the down side is some people use drugs as recreational use. i believe that pharmacist should become more stricter when people go and buy medications that are over the counter to restrain the people of using it as a recreational drug."
4,4,42.22 %,"healthcare, system, healthy, problem, good, food, program, disease, receive, cheap","Now although I don't know as much about the healthcare system as I would like, I can say that I think the main idea for the healthcare system is to help those people who cannot help themselves. This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living."
