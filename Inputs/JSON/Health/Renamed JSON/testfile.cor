The health care system should finance more money the people who are less healthy and ill or have some sort of disease and not as much to the people who are regularly healthy
with the exception of the elderly and the youth
Every health insurance in America should provide 2 to 3 free clinical check ups for a family of 3 or more, and 1 to 2 for single households.
medicare/medicaid should be equal people of all income but at the same time affordable
Insurance companies should make the co-payments based upon yearly household income.
This will help with people actually staying current on their health.
Medicare/Medicaid should get a "flex card" with so much money on it yearly so that will be able to pay for at least their prescriptions.
When prescribed drugs the doctor should have a bar code to scan so you can get them refilled more conveniently when you want to get the prescription filled at the drug store. This way the pharmacist can monitor what drugs you are getting and how much.
Physicians should evaluate and give tips to people who say they are having problems with certain issues before just automatically diagnose them with some disease that causes them to have to take medicine that they can become dependent on and start to abuse.
People with chronic illnesses should have specialists with reasonable prices so physicians can monitor their health more efficiently.
All doctors and physicians should have a small pharmacist that will be convenient for the patient to get their prescriptions refilled.
Physicians need to go to seminars and small courses to stay current on new things in the health world and what type of diseases have been detected lately so that less misdiagnosing occurs.
Emergency room visits should be less expensive. And pharmacies should have a small in and out clinics with reasonable prices for emergencies less severe than hospital attention for anyone with or without insurance.
Nursing homes should be covered by Medicare since some elderly do not have family that can afford it but need their loved ones to be monitored.
The government could pull out all money going into the healthcare system and the country would just have to build itself back up by people helping each other out.
People with chronic illnesses should seek the medical attention that they need no matter the financial situation.
All drugs should have a generic brand offered so people won't have to pay so much for the medicines that they need.
Birth control should be free so that pregnancies will decrease and Medicaid won't have to provide for that person and the unborn child as well. 
Seeing a dietician or a nutritionist should be free at least once a year so maybe that will cut back on visiting the primary doctor so much because natural health is sufficient and they are less likely to get ill.
There should be a universal healthcare system. Insurance companies are a big problem today
Physicians misdiagnosing patients is happening more often. The physicians should be evaluated regulary so it reduces the risk
Women clinics should be readily available and more awareness to prevent diseases/cancers
Being able to visit specialists with reasonable prices will also help in the long run--illness could improve or caught early before worsens, and less trips to a physician who could possibly not know what is wrong
Physicians should pay attention more to figuring out the cause of a particular problem rather than prescribing drugs to alleviate symptoms--more money gone to drugs and illness not cured
I think that people who have mental illnesses should be able to see a doctor or specialist at a reasonable cost
True, because sometimes money for drugs could result in substance abuse for certain cases.
Exactly. Saving both time and money without wasting the resources that the government has supplied.
I agree because it is ultimately up to the woman to decide for herself whether or not to have the baby and the risks that go along with it.
Seeing a dietician/nutritionist would also give the person a better picture as to where their health is, and how to improve it, to avoid going to the doctor at all.
I agree, but I feel that for those unemployed or have no intention of getting a job may have an issue paying it.
I think that emergency room visits should be free, if the emergency is one of actual concern. Not an "emergency" involving a headache or stomach problems that could be solved with over the counter medication, but rather emergencies involving deep cuts or severe infections.
I agree, because doing so would make the system more efficient without sending people away who actually need it. Also, you could get a better tab on how much of the substance is being used, and the doctor can tell if the patient is abusing the substance or not.
I think that every hospital or clinic should offer health care because people can't always get to the specific provider they have listed in their insurance. They could also need serious medical attention and not be able to get it at an affordable price.
Also, the mentally ill/disabled
Maybe they could also get coupons or cards allowing them to get a discounted visit to the doctor, or see a specialist.
True, so they won't be wasting money on false diagnoses. This would also make the system more reliable to the public, knowing that doctors have to stay current with the diseases and their symptoms.
The healthcare system must be changed in some features: The healthcare cost must be reduced as much as it is to help the low income or unemployed people or family to afford. OBAMA Care should be forced to bring the best health care services to everybody regardless their ability to pay for the Hospital bill In the education system, the doctors, specialists, or practitioners should be deep educated and good trained as well to give the best service to the patient and their family and I think this part is Okay. In order to save time and money, medical technology should be given and improve to give the best health care service for patients. For example, like we can use the robots instead of doctors to do an surgery, or using new invented radiology scanner to reduce the radio way, UV ray, ultrasound wave, etc. Everybody should be given the equal health care services as the cost should be low like in Canada, or Australia. Insurance, as in Obama Care that all people must obtain it regardless they never get sick. Although it may affect to the health service, but people will have more option in taking care their health more efficiency. Moreover, the education should teach all the doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses, or any people who work in the healthcare that the patient health is the most important than anything else, instead of taking their insurance or making a fast diagnostic. And I am looking for this aspect because as I see, there is not many doctors, physician, specialists, or nurses pay attention to this particular topic. Medicine should be lowered in price as in the generic medication that everybody can afford to buy though they have insurance or not. And this may help people more taking care for their health. Lastly, maintaining a good health is the best way to make we live better and we don't need to get the healthcare services every time we get sick unless we are getting old and need people to take care.
i agree because the women needs to be treated fairly as men and other aspects like age, gender, sexuality, education, family background, etc.
I think the generic should be get off to let the main one reduce in cost
This would reduce the cost of the prescribed drug then people would be able to afford it as well as have the oppurtunity to actually buy the medication that they need to take on a regular basis.
More clinics similar to Care-Now should be open but they should have family medicine doctors there so that misdiagnosing will be less likely to occur and the prescribing of drugs will be less likely to happen
Physicians should be monitored on what and how much they are prescribing to their patients because this may crack down on them getting certain drugs for promotional purposes and receiving things from the drug companies that they would normally not get if they were not prescribing these drugs. It is all about the money in these cases so some doctors really are not considered with their patients health.
Less immunizations might help people to actually be able to fight off some of these diseases that they are trying to prevent from coming back since new ones are introduced all the time.
More studies should go into looking at the patterns and trends of certain outbreaks globally and try to figure out a way to prevent them from continuously spreading.
HIV/AIDS patients should get coupons on their medications and also have an affordable specialized doctor to visit for regular check-ups. Also, they can be used for the process of trying to find a cure for the disease.
More restrictions should be placed on receiving Medicaid so that people who are lazy and really just want to rely on the government for help will be less likely to get it.
There should be more pharmacy with a local doctor or physician to conveniently get your medication and check-up at the same time
Another thing, I would like to mention from the previous post, they are: To the Disable people, HIV/AIDS patients, etc. serious diseases, they must to be treated fairly and appropriate to the normal people, or may be better than those because they are even weaker and depress for along time may be the whole life even with mental, physical, or social health. To the LGBT community, they also needs to be treated equally to other people regardless race, age, background, etc. And this is the task of the health care providers who are responsible in providing them the best quality health service. People who is in the Nursing home would be suffered so many problems and can't get away from aging, so they need to have a good care even about mental, physical, and social health treatment to make them enjoy the rest of life. It should be more health care show or programs as many health issue commercials to everyone to make an announcement or warning about any thing related to health like overdosing, street drug, eating habitat, passive life style, unhealthy behaviors,smoking, drinking, STDs, HIV thread, etc. There are now many and many case of rape related in the healthcare system, so it needs to pass a law or some restriction rules to reduce this issue as guaranteed the good working environment to all healthcare employees.
Yes, but not all people are like what you say. As I know there are so many people who are very lazy and dependence, but there are also people who get really sick and serious illness that they can not afford by themselves to pay for the medication as well as other health issues
I agree with you, it needs to have more to get the better health service and even though saving time and money.
I agree. Although healthcare covers most things, these specialized areas shouldn't be neglected, and should also recieve the same ammount of care, if not more, than the amount given in general healthcare.
 
Regular check ups on physicians should be required to make sure that they still have morals and values and really do care about the patients rather than they're paychecks.
The new technology would also reduce the amount of time that surgery would or regular everyday visits would take. Also with new things coming out there should be seminars for them to be displayed so that the doctors have a chance of purchasing them.
Support groups for people that are chronically ill should be provided by the government so that they have a better chance of thriving in life and not just to know that other people suffer but that they can help each other live a healthier lifestyle to try and relieve some pain and maybe even live longer.
If Medicare/Medicaid would crack down on the system and actually administer to the people who need it then taxes would probably go down because the government would not have to put so much money towards the healthcare system.
Assistant living for the elderly should be more affordable so that the nursing homes will not be so crowded, because some elderly people resort to the nursing home since that is all they're insurance will cover.
Maintaining a good healthcare system is the key reason so maybe the government should really evaluate this area more than all the other ones.
The budget for the healthcare services is reducing. So it needs to be considered to increase that amount of money. If the citizens are healthy, that means the country is also "healthy" too. Some new researches in Health science should be encouraged and granted by the governments or other foundations help the young new scientists to find the new methods and better cures for the patients or even a whole healthcare systems. Working hard will Many people are complaining about the healthcare insurance, not Medicare or Medicaid, so, there has to be some social benefits to qualify for those who are not getting enough financial supports for it. There must be some new hospitals build to server enough for the increasing patients where the old one is insufficient and does not well-qualified for the whole service. Any specialists or nurses who violate the policy or rules must be charged based on the scale of what errors they make during the healthcare services as will be a good model for others to obey and minimize the errors from little to zero.
I agree with you. even there are some people who cheat on this to get the free benefits for them.
Healthcare services is such a business where people who are insured will get the best service as they pay for what they receive.
That would be great! But people are in the way of busy working life so it needs the quick and fast service to serve as many people as it is and done well!
Yes I agree. In doing so, it would also reduce the funds required for those who don't care as much, for funding should only go to those who actually care.
This method sounds pretty solid in my opinion. The only problem is that sometimes there are more sick people than anticipated, and there isn't enough healthcare to deal with the amount of sickness that is presented.
As technology grows more advanced day after day, at some point there is going to be a way to monitor all of those who truly need healthcare. Hopefully people can do all of the necessary things to get the help they need, and get on track to becoming healthier. At this time, there should also be enough medication and staff to deal with those that need healthcare, for without the staff and supplies, healthcare will decrease, and more people will remain sick and die. At the rate technology is evolving, there should already be a system, unfortunately not everyone can be trusted with medication and the help that the staff provides.
But it will be very difficult to draw the line of what will fit under "emergency" if those visits are free completely. It should probably be at a more reasonable cost instead.
I think medical research is a big factor in providing adequate healthcare. More funding should be available to researchers to find cures for diseases, new techniques for procedures, new drugs, and ways to prevent illnesses.
I don't think that having a pharmacy and physician together will really make that much of a difference. there are more important things than making it "convenient" for the patient so they don't have to drive to a pharmacy. I'd rather have a more fit physician and pharmacist instead.
I agree and the more technology advances the more job opportunities for people without jobs leading to less dependent people on healthcare.
I agree on more research towards diseases which is one of the main sources of healthcare because if a cure is discovered then it gives the people who are ill to live healthy lives and get back on their feet.
I think the education of healthcare needs to be improved.
Finance is a sticky situation. I think the cost of healthcare should equally represent the benefits received, so in some ways the cost should be lowered.
Emergency room services need to improve. The hours to wait and the services provided are horrible.
Money could be a reason why for both. There should be a better investment for healthcare. No money means no pay which makes for a poor satisfaction and poor care to patients, and not enough people to operate the emergency rooms.
I don't want to see the healthcare system go away. The healthcare system itself is good, but the providers in charge of it need to be changed. I think if you take a group of people who are on the lower economy scale, dependent on healthcare, and have them either advise or run healthcare then maybe it would be in better standing.
In a touchy subject, healthcare has become too political. It's main focus should be the well being of sick, disabled and retired people. But now it's revolved around budget cuts, and as long as money is flowing around it doesn't matter if a veteran is lying on his deathbed because he doesn't have insurance to help him.
What if there was healthcare for a range of income? Or is there already? If there isn't then why not have higher income families pay a portion towards healthcare that they can afford, and then lower income families pay a portion that they can afford. It would be healthcare for all in a sense, but all of us would pay a different amount. A reasonable amount. ? :)
I personally believe that healthcare in this country is too expensive and frankly people on a budget do not see it necessary to obtain one. I believe that minor health problems should be free.
I have no problem with health insurance, however, I find that people pay unnecessarily for services that they do not need. Meanwhile those who need it cannot afford to pay for health care.
I find that health insurance only covers very little health concerns. Good health is not a guarantee so there should be others ways that people pay for health services.
I don't necessarily think that lack of health care education is a problem I think people who are uninformed remain that way because they cannot afford it.
There should be a clear distinction between providing healthcare to make a profit and healthcare for the less fortunate
i do not have much knowledge on the health care procedures, i believe that every employer should provide health care for their employees and families. Anyone who is not willing to work should buy health insurance independently and people who are disabled or old should be either on medicare or medicaid.
American people should not be responsible to pay for services that they do not require
I agree that the education about the health care system should be improved. I don't think it's a problem because people remain that way because they can't afford it. Yes, some people may choose not to learn more about it, but that's cause they might not feel the need to and that's why they feel less informed when asked about changes/improvements to the healthcare system. For example, young adults who are covered for healthcare by their parent's employers don't feel the need to learn about health care because they don't have to pay for it and it's not a concern for them.
I don't have much knowledge on healthcare or the financing, but this idea seems fair.
What are the problems with healthcare in America?
We can look at what other countries are doing and how they are doing it. And while this isn't specifically healthcare-related, we could put more focus on national happiness.
emergency rooms are for "emergencies."  a lot of times people go to them because they don't have a pcp, don't have the money for said pcp...so going to the emergency with a minor problem causes backups and long waits for people with more serious emergencies...so we could make pcps more accessible to everyone on all types of income
maybe educating the "youth" about healthcare or healthy habits will get them interested and start wanting to learn more...or at the least, make them aware of how to live "healthy" so that they'll be less likely to be obese, reckless, etc.
i think that most health care professionals try to focus on the sick, disabled, and retired people, but because many people don't have insurances or enough insurance, when they use medical services, those services aren't paid for.  Since they aren't paid for then the drs' nurses' medical profs. have to be mindful of money and services.  ideally money would have no part of receiving medical aide/help, but in reality, someone has to pay for services.  if no one pays, then services are less "good" or non-existent
i dont think that a different outlook or perspective will change health care that much if any.  someone who has less of an income than one who is overly wealthy are still both logical thinking people.  what it comes down to is that healthcare profs. have budgets.  users of health care services have bills.  if bills are paid, then budgets stay the same or increase.  if bills aren't paid, then budgets are lowered.  when budgets are lowered then so are services, treatment quality, staff...it's all connected and eventually plummets because hospitals/healthcare has to pay to people to work. if they can't pay because "users" dont pay their bills, then everything goes to crap....make people pay their bills, (either hold them personally reliable if no insurance, hold the insurance if they have it or make people HAVE insurance so that somewhere, someone can get paid and continue to work.  
i dont think that when you insurance that you are paying for services that you wont use.  just like car insur. you buy it because if ever you need it, it will be there.  you are paying for reassurance/stability/future help; not for something you wont need or ever use.  same with healthcare and insurance.  every should PAY SOMETHING just to be prepared.  make a separate item/deduction/tax on our paychecks so that we pay a little more to be safe.  and for people who can't afford to pay/dont work because sick/old/disabled, then either put into place more restrictions/people to monitor EFFECTIVELY there status for not working by way of sick/old/disabled to make sure that if anything changes, i.e. they become able-bodied, then the get to work to help out the others/pay it forward..
i dont think that another country's plan will necessarily work for the U.S.  every country is different; maybe they start their youlth/middle aged/elderly off on different tracks/have different ideologies that are DIFFERENT from the U.S.;  find what works here then do it.  and if that means trying out a dozen different things before we get that lucky 13th, then thats what we should do. 
take out health care altogether and only have independent drs.  then let people use "private pay" to do what they need to.  if some can't afford it, then they can't afford it..
A lot of you are concerned with cost, which yes I agree is a problem a lot of people who need medical care cannot afford it and may go into debt after seeking medical treatment. Sometimes it's hard to understand that medial care cost as much as it does because the equipment and medicines are very expensive. Medical technology is hard to keep up with and most facilities can't afford to get the things they need. If we did more research on finding cheaper more efficient ways to develop medical technology there would be a trickle down affect with cost.   
By law most people (ages 5-18) are required to go to school a certain number of days a year. We could have more programs in schools that inform students on healthcare and other health related issues. It is required to take an American government course to graduate most high schools and colleges, why not a course on the American healthcare system?
This isn't really fair, and most doctors aren't able to run practice independently without governmental assistance. What if the doctors were more in charge of their own practice and were able to work out payment plans and negotiate without governmental interference. A good majority of the decisions doctors make are influenced by insurance companies and the government.  
Denmark is happiest country in the world; meaning Denmark has the happiest citizens. They have free healthcare, absolutely free regardless of who you are no questions asked. They also have a 15% tax rate meaning 15% of their money goes to the government. Is the trade off worth it and will people be willing to make that sacrifice?
I agree! Even I don't know everything about the healthcare system, and my family lives off of it. Eventually the youth is going to be in charge, so we need to know about how to run it.
okay I see where you are coming from, but how do we get people to pay? Some people are just skimming the ice making what they can for their families, so they feel the need that some bills don't need to be paid. We can't just force them, or can we??
I honestly don't know anymore. My ideas now are coming from a futuristic book I've read once where everyone was split into districts and they produced what they could in that area. Maybe we could do the same, but instead we'd be split based on income and needs. We pay for what we can afford, and we receive what we put effort into...I know it's sketchy though because some of us deserve more than what we work now based on previous efforts, so maybe we can accommodate that too...???
I agree, but we need to be cautious about how many systems we adopt because eventually we might burn out and people won't be happy if we continue to constantly change our system...?
mental health care should be easily accessible because it is one of the main causes of destruction and violence in America. I mean, a number of people cannot afford to obtain this kind of health care and as such they are forced to suffer in silence.
there is a definite need for more doctors, i believe this is a problem because a lot of dedicated doctors took a heavy loan and spend a long time paying off their dept that it is not encouraging for high school students to even consider that path, its just too much dept and too long
"Force" is a harsh word, but yes, I think that people who don't have healthcare or don't pay/have the means to pay their bills should be forced.  Single/divorced parents ask the courts to have the other parent pay; the other parent's wages are garnished; the petitioner get his/her owed child support.  The same could/should be done with society and medical bills.  A family may just be skimming by with their most/more important bills, but $5 or $10 a month will, eventually, get their bills paid and will help cover the costs that they use.  Over time, the health profs., drs., nurses, etc. will have more funding available and so we can stop the decline in health care and begin with an incline. 
I have never actually been to an emergency room, but I have been told that it just is not worth it. Apparently, the queue is too long and forms take too long to fill but, most importantly it just cost way too much.
That's a good question- will people of the US be willing to pay the tax rate that will enormously help provide free healthcare for all citizens?
I agree with being cautious.  But, as a whole/as a country, with one change in how health care works, we've seen society go crazy.  With any change, there will be people who get mad, but I think that if we work, regardless of people burnout/get angry, towards a "good" system that benefits all Americans to some sort of extent, then we as a whole will be able to over look the trouble it took us to get there.  Other countries didn't just invent/put into place a "good" working health care system overnight; it took time to develop and implement it.   
there is too much of a conflict in this country about healthcare in as much as it would be a fantastic thing to have a free healthcare system in this country i still believe that this would not solve the problem...there would still be some very unhappy chaps in America
forcing them is not the issue, i believe it is the role of the government to make them understand that healthcare bills are the ones worth paying
  To be honest, 15% is probably the median when it comes to healthcare costs at the moment.  We pay about $200/month for our family's insurance and that is about the same percentage in how much my wife brings in/month.  If everyone has to pay a higher tax rate, I would be somewhat upset because then I would be paying more a month.  But if we really think about it, with the amount that we pay in taxes and insurance /month, if you have insurance or work, will most likely be the same amount.  For some cheaper (if you have a low paying job), and for some more expensive (if you have a high paying job or multiple incomes).  Yes we would be paying "more," but the quality of health care would go up because they have their money/the funds to adequately treat and prevent and wouldn't have to worry about money. 
This is a good idea. It's like how students are required to take classes about the American economy and government. Although many are only required to take it for a semester, and I think these two are very important classes. Many students don't learn a lot or retain a lot from these courses, yet the information is vital. It could either be a separate course or integrated into another course mandatory for students, but it's very important for students to learn about the health care system as well as the American economy and government.
  some would be unhappy, but with time they will get over it, (most of them anyway). 
I think that this is a great idea.  Maybe even start it earlier like in elementary.  Have this incorporated into recess or P.E./health class/social studies so that the students grow up with it.
Of course a free healthcare system won't solve everyone's happiness. It would take care of everyone's health, but inevitably there will be people who are unhappy for whatever reason.
Why don't people have more control over their health care? People complain about insurance companies, cost of medical care, treatment, everything a person could complain about! If people had more of a say they would feel like they get what they pay for and be more satisfied with the health care system. People like to have control, give patients more rights to decide on what they want. Don't allow insurance companies to make our decisions for us, but then here comes the problem of education... most people don't even know their options... How can we give people more control?
So let's talk about free health care. It sounds fantastic! I would absolutely love to have free health care in the US, but we have never had free health care. Does anyone realize how many jobs would be lost? There would be no more medical insurance companies... Do you realize how many people are employed there? Also the quality of medical care would go down, the general attitude of medical staff would be "well I'm getting paid anyway."
The way free health care works in other countries is that people still have insurance in case of very serious cases, however, free healthcare is administered to people to educate them on how to take very good care of their bodies and not attain very contagious diseases. for example the general check-ups and the occasional flu will be treated under the free health care system. But, emergencies will require a valid health insurance. by doing this the price of prescription drugs will be elevated and insurance might be able to cover this; so it will still be necessary to have insurance.
The attitudes of medical healthcare professional is not very different now, a number of doctors and medical practitioners are only interested in the salary, that is why medicare and medicaid fraud are on their highest ever right now. I understand that doctors deserve the pay that they get mainly because they spend so much healthcare plan might work. 
So we should most likely take surveys of the opinion of people and what they want to see come of healthcare and then compare it to systems in different nations and then see which system works best. It gives the people what they want (maybe not all) and a chance to change our system.
It sounds okay, but let's take the flu example. The cost/demand of vaccines will take a toll on payment. We can't cover everyone. However unless you're talking about visits being free then I see a possible idea, but providers won't be happy and will see it pointless to continue their practice if they aren't be paid.
Have more research done on mental health
Long term health care should be easily accessible after your senior age
Financial support for shelters that deal with the aftermath of domestic violence, those in poverty, etc.
All in one insurance
What more can we do to help those affected with a mental health disorder
Pharmaceuticals that can be used for something illegal should be carefully distributed.
Emergency Room waiting area can make room for a doctor on floor, in case something happens.
Better technology provided in smaller clinics
Start educating children from a younger age then just having a one semester health class in high school.
Maybe starting when kids are in middle school and having not just a powerpoint lesson but instead a discussion on what could be done and how to prevent health risk and becoming pregnant at a young age
Instead of having doctors volunteer at the facilities and clinics that except no insurance why not pay doctors for there services still so maybe they will care more about the people they see that can not get insurance
Offering people with no insurance more places to go if an emergency occurred
Stop letting health care providers reject you just because you might be in bad health before getting a health care provider
Educate people on the different types of insurance
The government can set aside funding for research for incurable diseases
Stop making the wait so long for emergency room patients
Having people who have dealt with family members or children with mental health problems educate parents who might have just found out about it
Having more smaller clinics be able to provide the same technology like bigger clinics
Maybe making medicine cheaper for people who have no insurance
Make it to were everybody can afford insurance
Have the doctor look at the patients in the emergency room to see if the patient needs to be treated faster than others
Get educators for health to go around schools and teach kids and educate kids more if needed 
Do not just let the schools offer one aspect on safe sex make them talk about all the options
Increase taxes and use that money to provide universal healthcare
Research ways in detecting people who have a mental disorder early in the stage and treat them right away. This could prevent a lot of tragedies from happening.
Strict policies need to be enforced on doctors who prescribe highly addictive drugs to patients. They should have routine check on those patients and make sure they are not using the drugs out of context.
Develop diagnostic technologies that can detect a patient's illness precisely because a lot of the times doctors do multiple tests on patients that costs thousands of dollars. These tests can sometimes be deemed useless because they don't provide an answer to the problem.
Universal healthcare should be provided to only those who pay their taxes. As for the people who don't, there should be cheap alternatives that may not provide the same quality of care but get the job done.
A lot of the times, guidance counselors are not in touch with the girls at school about anything. Students need someone who will talk to them openly about safe sex, birth control, etc. Make the topic an open discussion and a not a taboo subject that is discussed only after the girl gets pregnant.
Adderol abuse in colleges is becoming a serious problem. Not to mention certain pharmaceuticals are the root of most illegal drugs being made in America today. Doctor's usually only get to see their patient once in situations where they diagnose, therefore they pass out prescriptions as a precautionary measure instead of actually reasoning if the patient truly needs the prescription. There needs to be discrete testing (i.e. personality tests or motor skills testing) that could be done in the waiting room or online before an appointment so the doctor can assess the results and have a better understanding of the patients true psychological, mental, or physical well-being before they're forced to diagnose the patient in one sitting.
Unless the person has a rare, or very severe problem, local Wal-marts, CVS pharmacy, or Walgreen's stores already provide very inexpensive generic medicines (both on the shelf and over the counter) with no insurance needed. However the biggest issue I see when it comes to medicine, is the big companies who patent their medicine when it's the only quality cure for a particular health problem. I'm usually not a person for government stepping into a business' business, but when that one company can charge ridiculous prices just because they're the only seller, there is a problem.
That sounds fine, however you cant tell an insurance company that they're "not allowed" to turn down anyone for any reason because the business would crash, and even if they're not allowed to turn down a customer because of health reasons, they'll just claim that the reason they turned them down was because of financial background, career, etc. If the government wants to have insurance company that doesn't turn people down because of health conditions, then they might as well set it up themselves. However, that federal dollar funded organization will probably suffer a significant loss in $$ similar to the US Postal Service.
The Health Care System right now is forcing too much upon the people and businesses as well. The main concern shouldn't be making every single person in American pay for every service that most will not use just so that a few can take advantage of it. The main concern should focus on helping the lower class who needs the services, obtain the standard of living that can provide them. Instead of throwing billions of tax dollars into food stamps and welfare checks, focus that money into creating the mass amounts of jobs that encourage the poor to get back on their feet, rather than giving to them handouts that encourage laying down.
Educating the young in middle and high school with actual programs to expand upon the potential risks of smoking, sex, and other health concerns could be very beneficial if funding went to having a good program set forth.
The health care system was built around helping your neighbor in a sense. In a group of ten people, one person might get six so the other 9 people would pay for a safety net if you will. One of the major problems is that our system doesn't account for a population boom, i.e. "Baby-Boomers". There are ways we can band aid the situation or make a temporary fix as in increasing the restrictions. This would restrict the health care given though, but it would give quality care to the ones that really need it. There are a lot of possibilities to "band-aid" the situation. However, to major fix the system we would have to get me details about the cost expenditures of the Healthcare system and it's sub-section. The current place we are at now is exhausting resources thus we are already restricting the health care system by this. The long term fix is going to come from preventative care i.e. technology and education. If we restrict the current health care system for awhile, there is no easy fix. Then we could make grants for study for colleges or firms to research the diseases, recovery rate, etc... This would give the incentive to invent new techniques to pre-screen patients for ailments then categories the patients in there system which could reduce the emergency room wait time. Another way is to spread out the load on the system thus you would need other places for the traffic to go. However this can be more costly because of upkeep cost and it would take time to build, but the long term effect is having clinics that can serve for the minor emergencies or non life threatening emergencies. The problem with this though is the people would have to know what the two are and how they are different. An example if your getting robbed you call 911, if you hear shots fired you call 911, but if you lose your wallet do you call 911? Thus, you would need education. Education would help reduce the work load through people going to where they are suppose to go for a given emergency, not to mention them themselves eating healthier, treating themselves better, etc...
In Canada they have free health care since we know its possible i think we should aim for that.
Instead of one emergency room in hospitals there should be at least two that have requirements so it can be less of a wait.
Finances shouldn't be so high once you get your bill from your recent hospital visit, so i think the bill paying should be paid only if the heavy or important things were used while at the hospital. If the physician didn't use important equipment then the bill shouldn't be so expensive.
Insurance should come in different levels sort of like today but different. The first level is free for everyone and the next levels you would have today. The free package will still be treated as to the other packages. With the free package you still would get great service and quality. In the other packages the differences will be your family can stay all together as one health insurance verses your child leaving when they are 19.
The education shouldn't be messed with but the cost should go down since the school is already hard to get into ; which is a good thing; they cost should shorten.
The reason doctors use such important equipment is so that we can be treated to the best of their abilities. They are expensive because they are the best equipment.   
How is school and health care related?
What kind of levels should they have? Since you already have explained they are similar to the ones we already have today?
I believe health care should be a little more affordable. The cost of living is already going up but the cost of staying alive shouldn't go up as well. Like taxes, the government takes out a percentage based on what the person makes, the cost of health care should be the same way. Because everyone makes different amounts of income the cost of health care should cost accordingly. 
But are our physicians just as good-quality as Canadian physicians? Is it quantity over quality? Free is convenient but you also have to think are you getting the best treatment possible?
What kinds of requirements should these emergency rooms have?
When someone is overweight and they want to loose weight they will most likely go to the doctor and ask what the doctor has for them as a solution. Most doctors will suggest lipo-suction, body wraps, or weight loss pills. But has a doctor ever prescribed a healthy meal plan, or a work out schedule? Of course not! America is a business, Americans want money. Its very seldom that doctors will actually care about their patients more than making a profit out of them. Lipo-suction, body wraps and weight loss pills are quite expensive, healthcare does not cover it, in the end you are paying for confidence instead of working for it. What a caring doctor should prescribe is a dose of "lay off on the McDonalds", work out regularly and choose to be healthy. A healthy mindset can also build the confidence of a person for a lifetime and is the fuel for motivation.
It seems like everyone wants cheap cost but no one wants cheap care. The reason health care is expensive is so we can have the best care available.
What would be a reasonable percentage to take out for health care?
They should try a system where the amount you pay for health care should be determined by how many times you visit a doctor, with exceptions to the people who are chronically ill like patients with cancer
there are people constantly visit doctors because they are over weight and that effects how much we pay for healthcare so the people who choose to make bad choices should have to pay for their own action instead of making the general population pay as a whole
instead of spending tax payers dollars on trying to prevent obesity that money could be better spent somewhere else. For those people who decide to be obese should have to pay for their own actions. They are adults an should be responsible for what they eat and drink, the government should not have to spend money on telling you not to eat fast food everyday or to exercise   
There should be a maximum on how much a health care provider can charge a person because it would not hurt the health care providers to take a salary decrease
One could be for more urgent care and the other could be for injuries that would be okay to wait awhile
I think everyone should have to pay the same amount. I don't think people should have to pay more just because they make more money.
I think if health care was free, the quality of it would decrease.
This money should be put towards education for healthcare so that the quality and technology can continue to increase.
Yes, there should be maximums for charges but I don't think it should affect their salary. Doctors have to pay to keep their office open and operating.
We Americans rely to much on pharmaceuticals. I believe we should have tighter regulations on the drugs that can be prescribed by doctors, and over the counter medicines. I say this because there are many examples of patients becoming dependent on these drugs leading to other health care related issues. 
Adding to your point, I believe one of the biggest weapons we have against America's health system in general is exercise. All of the studies in the area of exercise have the benefits greatly out-weighting the risk. I believe America needs to stop leaning on pharmaceuticals, as a solution. Exercise is shown to be a tool against prevention of bad health,  and when one becomes ill exercise is also shown that exercise will help the body recover. 
While I do believe health care should be cheaper for the average joe. I don't believe healthcare should be force onto people who don't need it, or simply just don't want it. I feel that it's a waste of money. I also think it break our constitutional rights.
ObamaCare?
There needs to be changes in Medicad, Medicare
There needs to be an advancement in the study of mental health. I feel like its such a black and grey area. Having the proper diagnosis on a person and treatment for the person.
Even at that do we have the best care? Health care is expensive but that doesnt mean its the best. For something to be good it doesn't need to be high in price.
Health care should be the same all around since we all are getting the same health care. So if you make more money than others why should they pay more for the same outcome
A friend of mine's mother just recently broke her leg and back, she went to the doctors to get it checked out and it turns out she has to get $5000 worth of surgery done to repair the damage. She is also an older woman so it will also take more time to heal. Her family does not have that kind of money and her insurance does not cover the costs of the surgery. I think this is sad America, $5000 seems like a reasonable amount but the fact that insurance does not cover the cost of this surgery makes me sick to my stomach. If the government does not want to lower cost of health care then America's insurance companies should offer to cover more of our peoples' needs.
McDonald's makes more money than these insurance companies, if not the same amount, maybe if we put more money into staying fit and healthy we would not need to go to the doctors for health related problems.
instead of spending money on telling people what to eat they should use that money to open a community gym so that there is a place for people to go workout.
I was referring to  the the insurance company not the doctors.
the problem with that is that eating out is so much cheaper and faster compared to trying to eat healthy so maybe finding a way to make healthier food cheaper would decrease the amount of money people spend on fast food.
If they could make healthy food more widely available then maybe people will choose to make the healthier decision.
on the education side they could make taking a nutrient class in middle school a requirement so they kids can learn how to eat healthy and what types of food are good for you and that are easy to make.
And also not as expensive. It's way cheaper and easier to eat off the dollar menus at fast food places.
I agree. I think putting nutrition classes in schools is the best way to inform people of the importance of eating healthy.
make healthcare more affordable
Universal healthcare. I think Canada and Denmark have universal healthcare. The US could reform its healthcare system using one or more of these countries as a prototype.
Make the interior of hospitals less depressing.
Improve quality of hospital food.
Expedite wait times in emergency rooms.
Improve quality of nursing homes and closely monitor the employees treatment of its residents to curb elderly abuse.
Require doctors or nurses to explain the specifics (side effects, etc.) of pharmaceuticals, as well as alternative medications to patients before prescribing them.
Doctors could start making house calls again.
Include America's healthcare system as a topic in the government class curricullum in high schools
Doctors should ask about mental health at their patients regular check ups and refer them to therapy or other treatments when necessary
As well as the long-term effects of medication. Such as the psychological effects of prolonged use of ADHD medications.
Learning about the healthcare system at an early age could enable students to think of new ideas in order to improve the system in the future.
The U.S healthcare system should be like Canada's healthcare system.
Hospitals should look for cheaper methods they could use that are as efficient as the expensive methods to cure their patients
If we cannot have a universal healthcare system like Canada or other countries, then we should make healthcare affordable to all citizens.
Pharmaceuticals should be aware of all the medications being prescribed at their pharmacy so that they do not harm anyone with the new products.  In other words new products should be tested so that people do not get sick from them and then need medical attention because of it.
Laws should be made to secure anything that will prevent anyone from not getting the healthcare they need.
Emergency room services should be at an equal service to all patients.
Cut off the expenses that are unnecessary
Using the prototype healthcare of another county could help the US with the framework of a new healthcare system. Possibly making it better and more efficient all citizens.
Hospitals should spend less on the look of the hospital, but more on how their services are given equal to their patients.
Improve waiting lines for sick patients.
Unless everyone agrees to put on the effort to make healthcare for everyone, well then everyone should have access to it. But if they do not then they have the right to exclude them from it.
Depending on how severe someone is hurt then they should be skipped to the front of the line. If they medical attention that you need is not as an emergency then you should be willing to let others get treated first.
Get a public figure to encourage citizen in raising up money that will be used only on keeping US citizens healthy, or at least helping them get the medical attention that is needed at all times.
By all means if you have the money to get at the front of the line, well they better pay double so that money can circulate and it can be used for other medical expenses.
they should make it a different system to be seen in a emergency room, because you arent there to wait you have an emergency so obviously need to be seen quickly. In and out service. maybe get more doctors for the emergency room
I believe sick people should be treated at a doctors office so they could take up less room in the emergency room so the people with broken bones, severe chest pains, and serious stuff besides a cold or flu or whatever can be treated quicker.
they should make insurance plans affordable to anyone and everyone because this is a reason why hospitals are constantly backed up. Because not everyone can afford to pay a doctor.
do away with obamacare and start from scratch by looking at reality now, not seeing how to improve what we already have.
definitely yes, you are paying good money for your dear old loved one to be taken care of and payed attention to, so that is the obvious reason they are in there in the first place because some families only have time to visit not enough time to check on their meds and health 24/7
i think the same that hospitals should worry less about the architecture of their building unless they are accommodating on the number of rooms for patients rather than the style or appearance of the place to save money on decorations and spend it on equipment
make healthcare more accessible to immigrants who are becoming citizens because they are coming here for equal opportunity in which they dont get i their previous country so they obviously deserve health insurance, not for free but just given a better opportunity to achieve it like any other citizen of the US
equal rights for sure across the board and across stratification levels in society
Hospitals are going paperless so heavy use of technology such as flat screens, table cart computers, bar codes, and tablets are really helping the physicians to retrieve the patients' medical records faster.
they should be given equal medical treatment even if it means most people are not being able to pay for the hospital bills.
Hospitals are actually going paperless so they are installing many computers and flat screens.
It is more manageable to track down patients' medical records from computer than piles of copy paper.
Totally agree, this way the young generation will be open to ideas for future.
Also the costs of the medications and alternate ways to pay for it.
The doctors should be able to interact with the patients easily.
Healthcare System should be talked about more than how it really is right now. Most people do not know much about the healthcare system and it should be known to them as it affects them.
Healthcare isn't necessarily secure for elderly people.
It should be quick too, less waiting time for the patients.
Hospitals should be an affordable place for sick people who believe they can get better by the doctors.
The pharmacist should explain to the patients thoroughly about the medications like when to take it and with what or the side-effects of the medications.
Everyone should get equal medical attention so it should not matter if one is wealthy or poor.
I've always thought this should be put in place. The only problem I could see would be that maybe taxes would have to be raised so that the doctors and nurses would still make money to live on.
again the only way we could do this is to raise taxes.
they do this already. The medicine cannot be widely distributed if it has major side affects that make the patient worse.
This is a good idea. If you have a minor cut that needs to be stitched and someone comes in with a limb cut off or something just as severe, they should get treatment first.
the only problem with this is that if someone has no medical insurance a normal doctor will not see them and their only option is the emergency room. That's why healthcare reform is needed.
that way more minds will have more ideas about what to do with our healthcare. Also, more people will be informed about it.
The healthcare system should be taught in high school, like in government or something.
This way maybe more citizens would try to fix the flaws the healthcare system has.
They should hire more doctors, that way everyone has an equal opportunity to be attended by one
Nurses should be required to know as much as a doctor that way they can be more useful whenever a doctor is not there.
Students in high school should be encouraged to look for ways to improve the US healthcare, that way in the future something will be actually done for it.
Intensify a committee that will find the perfect healthcare system for the US.
Get more people involved in the flaws that US has rather than foreign ones.
It's not the rich people's fault that they can afford doctors, Americans should worry about ways to save money so that they too can afford doctors or invest that money to improve the way it is spent in the medical fields to help cure people.
Before we try to fix our healthcare system we should fix the things that are preventing us from improving it overall. Which is the whole money problem.
Instead of loosing territory to new Wal-Mart's we should use that territory to build new hospitals or clinics.
Require all doctors to do a certain amount of pro bono work on special cases like sick children whose family's cannot afford medical treatment.
Increase funding on stem cell research.
The U.S. should do away with abstinence-only education in high schools, and start teaching safe sex practices. Teenagers are going to have sex no matter what so they should be well informed on methods of contraception so they can adequately protect themselves from STDs and unplanned pregnancies.
Legalize abortion in all states and make it more affordable.
Find a way to increase money funds so that the hospitals can use them in order to promote better care.
There should be seperate and smaller community groups that is working on this health care plan and also publicizing more of this topic in the news so that people can know what is going on.
The waiting is too long for emergency care. May be they should start improving with the emergency unit first.
even if they build hospitals and clinics it will be no use if people cant afford to go.
there should be like programs for poor people who can apply to get help in paying for the medical bills.
Basically, everything revolves around money so they should think first about how to distribute money.
The workers of the hospitals should be friendly and reliable because many of them dont smile and it does really hurt the reputation of the hospitals.
There should also be diversity in workers because it might be easier for patients to interact more with workers that are from same place. Increase diversity.
US could use Canada as an example and if they find some flaws in Canada, they could always improve that part in US.
People should be given the care they deserve.
Medical practice should be given equally to everyone despite how their look, their age, gender, and wealth.
i have recently learned that obama passed a law for birthcontrol to be free, i believe if you have insurance, so i believe everyone should have a fair chance of free birthcontrol like people with insurance.
they should also make the hospital for people with major problems, not for people who have a cold or flu or something to that extent. It is annoying when you are trying to get a broken body part looked at and you have to wait in line behind the people who cant afford normal doctors so they take up space in the EMERGENCY room. in other words they should reform hospital standards and change rates on health insurance so the poor people that go to the emergency room for a cough, can instead go to a family doctor.
i think that those commercials like Everest those online schools make it to easy for people to get out in the medical field, whether it be a receptionist of just a nurses aid. I think that the medical field should require degrees with top notch nursing programs and up. Even UTA for example, it is smaller than UT A&M but we still have a wonderful program. Can you really trust people that graduate from online schools. Yeah they can pass a MCAT but by how many points? Raise the passing percentage of the medical field tests to make sure we are getting quality doctors handling our LIVES.
I 100% agree fully with this. One problem at a time. i think we should focus on getting out of debt first.
quit spending money on putting mcdonalds on every corner of every street too.
Health care system should crack down more on the obesity in schools. We are becoming a nation where its socially acceptable to be fat and die fat. its disgusting, and saddening to think that other nations stereotype us Americans as a bunch of fat people. It is seriously not hard to teach good nutrition in schools and make nutritious meals without making them taste disgusting and fake as they do now.
Create an app for emergency rooms and other medical facilities that allow patients to check in and fill out all the usual paperwork digitally. This would cut down on paper costs and potentially make the check in process at hospitals more efficient. Perhaps include features like estimated wait time or allow the patient to see the number of people waiting ahead of them.
Legalize marijuana for medicinal use in the U.S.
People would not feel secure if someone who graduated online is treating them.
Legalizing marijuana is an issue in US which should be taken care of soon. Marijuana is good for medical purpose so if it is legalized then it should be legalized only in hospitals.
I think this is a great idea, we will be saving trees and patients.
I agree that it could be hard for people to trust someone who graduated from an online school.
Get rid of online medical programs, because people need to be training with hands on experience.
Almost everyone has iphone or ipads or technology of some sort. They could use these technologies to help them have a healthy lifestyle. For example, they could download the apps in their phones which provide their BMI check up or weight check up for free. This could really help many from less hospitals visits.
If some people cannot afford being treated, then they won't be able to afford buying the technology to do this.
Now the people who really care about their health have many ways to keep them in shape. The apps in the phones have exercising routines from which people can follow up 20 min everyday and be healthy for coming years ahead of them.
I think that the amount of restaurants in US is really making everywhere else to think that the US is a fat country.
The people should be required to volunteer more hours in the hospitals so that they are experienced.
There is really no excuse to not being healthy. Even an app can help out a person, so idk why so many people complain about not being in shape. It is all a matter of choice and action.
I think that the field tests should be very practical because we learn by experience and not just by memorizing the books.
A diverse environment inside hospitals would help people be more accepting with other races. It would help patients be friendly to people they have never interacted with.
They could create an app that everyone can afford and its only one-time buying too so that everyone can use it whenever they want without buying it each time.
We are way to involved in foreign affairs. Like hurricane Katrina, the first people to actually show up and help were Canadian officers and Cubans I believe, where were the American federals? Something doesnt seem right there.
Definitely need to get rid of online medical programs. It is way to easy to get a degree in medical fields and have no hands on experience. It is very scary to think people without in school degrees and internships are handling our nations patients!
And in that, the government should do something about health insurance for the poor to keep them out of emergency rooms and in with family doctors or Quick Care services to make room for people who actually need emergency care. Most hospitals are filled with sniffling/ coughing people who go there just because they cant afford a doctor and therefore taking up emergency room doctors time of treating actual emergency patients.
Bingo! Our government needs to realize yes we are an open nation and that is great! But as an open nation we should have the number one priority of focusing on our growing nation and accommodating to the needs of Americans because we are all here for one thing and that is to achieve the American Dream.
Personally, I think that if doctors and nurses, etc. were on a government paycheck like police officers or firemen then it would be easier to give health care to anyone who needs it, rather than the people who can afford it.
this is not true for all birth control. If it's true at all. I take birth control every day and I pay $50 a month for it. WITH insurance.
we don't pay for that? the Mcdonald's cooperation, or the people who own that land pay for the Mcdonald's to be built. The reason that big companies like Walmart and Fast food chains are more common than hospitals is because they have the money to pay for the land and the development of the buildings.
exactly. I went to the J-spot seminar a few weeks ago and the speaker showed a video of what sex education is like in MIDDLE schools in parts of Europe, and it was more education about sex than I saw in high school. It talked about the different parts of the sexual organs and how you're supposed to treat them. Also, about stds and things you shouldn't do during sex to make sure you're safe.
The only problem is that the person has to be qualified. I'm not about to take myself or a loved one to a doctor with no experience.
Honestly, the only way healthcare reform is going to happen is if there is money to do it. The only way I can see that happening is if the government spends less on the military and useless goods that no one really needs from other countries and starts focusing more on it's own problems rather than the rest of the world's. Start manufacturing the medication here in the US to make it more affordable. Educate US citizens and give them scholarships to go to medical school rather than people who are only here to get an education then move back to their own country. We need to focus on ourselves before we try and give our time and money to other places in the world.
The people who need healthcare the most and can't afford it would not be able to afford technology at all.
They can't download an affordable app if they don't have the device the app is available for. Not everyone owns an iphone or an android.
If the people who need the healthcare reformed the most don't really care then nothing will change. It needs to be more widely educated so that people know what options are available to them.
I don't understand why people who are here illegally need to be treated in the hospitals that our money pays for. They sit in the emergency room with a cold because they can't get insurance to go to a regular doctor and this takes away from the people who are in an actual emergency with appendicitis or something worse. I understand that they came here to get a better life, etc. but if someone I love dies in an emergency room because a bunch of illegal immigrants were taking up the beds I'd be very very upset.
this would not be quicker. it would be more stressful for doctors and nurses, and they would be in such a rush to get to every patient that they could miss minor details in a persons health that could be deadly.

yes, because some of the more affordable clinics are not up to code and professional, discouraging people from going to such clinics.
there should be a annual seminar held in schools to inform students of diseases that are common or expected to be common that year and the measures that can be taken to prevent the diseases.

keep all companies that have anything to do with health-related issues in human beings from telling lies in order to benefit for themselves
such as? i dont think mentally handicapped should be treated as second class citizens
facts are important
have more people in the medical field be searching for cures to diseases
such as guns and weapons that could be used unconsciously or unknowingly against themselves or others. background checks and psychological tests before purchase of weapons would help this
maybe the ER should also decrease in cost
guns dont kill people, people kill people
hire strictly researchers, instead of someone trying to juggle being a doctor and researching
If the side effects outweigh the benefits of a drug the drug should not be used
yes, so background checks on the people purchasing the guns would solve problems with unnecessary/inappropriate use of them which would decrease the amount of accidents resulting in the need of medical assistance
make learning about healthcare easier
nearly impossible due to the amount of people that need it
Finance more towards technology curing people faster and more efficiently and stopping them from visiting again
Divert funds to states and let states decide how health care should be administrated
Give only necessary needs rather than maximum benefits to save funds for more needy people
Provide more ER's in low income regions for better convenience
Make education in health care more readily available to those in need of it 
Eliminate Medicaid and create a more stabilized system that works across different types of incomes not just the poor
Assign long-term schedule for when to visit with a doctor yearly/monthly depending on level of needs
Fund technology for pharmaceuticals to better enhances the treatment to a sickness
Start education of health at younger ages, grade school (elementary up to high school)
Eliminate non-important expenditures and direct them towards health care
Make health insurance more accessible and open to lower income families
Create jobs in the health care industry that both educate the employees and help the lower income families
make education of health care more available to the public via. online classes or public seminars
Eligibility for free or low cost health care depending on your economic status
Provide preventive care such as t-dap, menigitis, etc. to lower income and people who are not aware of the diseases.
Increase the fund for technology in preventive medicine to fight future outbreaks and diseses
Create an insurance that focuses mainly on health care
Create better and more healthcare providing institutions and make them more convenient
Show people how to be healthy and stay healthy  :P
Food-Banks and Food-drives must provide healthier food for those in need
Provide better care for mental health in order to educate people on health care
medicine should be available at lower cost for those with lower income
insurance policies should be easier to understand by any body, not filled with unnecessary literature 
focus more on helping people who are sick rather than making money off that person
hospital waiting areas can be more efficient, waiting areas can be crowded even with tons of staff there
becoming a healthcare professional should be a little easier, as in some parts in medical school can be consolidated
elementary, middle, and high school students should be taught about healthcare, insurance, and medical schools
all doctors should accept the same insurance across the board, not having the option for certain doctors.
many food producing companies tell the full truth about their products but put it in words that the average consumer would not understand. Something should be done so that the average consumer knows these different terms.
maybe not a lot easier, but definitely a lot more affordable.
the goal should be to cure not to treat.
convenient and affordable.
instead of all of the advertisement seen of fast foods, cigarettes, and alcohol, there should be advertisements promoting healthy habits.
yes because many times the drug itself is worse than what is being treated.
a first aid course should be mandatory for all jobs, not just those dealing with children.
healthy foods should be cheaper since many times the unhealthy foods are more affordable.
organic foods should be available in all grocery stores and should be cheaper especially because there aren't any other preservatives in them. the cost should be less rather than more than foods grown with pesticides
people who use things like tobacco or are obese have put themselves in their health situations so they should be liable.
there should emergency centers within 5 miles of any population of people
there should be a limit, like in new york city, on how big a coke you can buy since they are bad for you
unless the person is diabetic or has another weight and food intake control issue, they should be held responsible for their actions leading them to this
more portion controlled containers. if there isn't a lot more than what you're supposed to have there, then less people will be coerced into eating more than a serving
and if they arent accountable to the appointments they should be fined for possibly harming themselves which consequently drives healthcare up
states simply cannot support all the healthcare funds without federal support
create punishments for refusing to visit regularly scheduled appointments without notice and rescheduling
also many restaurants should start cutting back on portions size
individual states can act as a guinea pig, but the amount of healthcare for all of a state's citizens would put some states in debt. keep health insurance federal, but allow states to try out different healthcare systems using federal funds
require elementary and middle schools to keep their children active in gym activities or at recess
make gym memberships cheaper and closer to home
create apps for phones and computers that can accurately track the correct amount of calories you eat and burn throughout the day, not necessarily just calories burned at the gym
require brain scans and other mental health indicators after a certain age, just like colon checks and women's health checks
they should also remind you when you havent been to the gym in a while
school lunches are horrendous too, make them healthier
make calls to members and sometimes this will persuade them to come back to the gym by playing off of their insecurities
take steps toward ending childhood obesity
all medical centers and doctors should accept any type of insurance policy
first for the healthy companies to afford these ads they must sell more product
pharmaceutical companies are too powerful anyway
create more of a physically active and healthy-eating society. make values and norms based around healthy living
Further focus on health care within the education system (Ex. Different type of health care class each year in high school)
Teach the public how to efficiently set aside funds for health care.
Greater reliance on preventive care
Create a more efficient and sustainable health care provider to assist the needs of low income and uneducated families
Both should be implemented to prevent unhealthy habits and advertise a healthy lifestyle
Much like alcohol, prohibit it during certain times of the week/day.
Leave health care policies and restrictions up to each individual state, have government only provide funds to carry out the process, funds determined by the size of population and number of those in need of health care benefits
Create more jobs within health care to both fund the costs and educate those who are employed
Discover new ways to implement health care by observing other successful systems in other countries (i.e. London, Canada, etc.)
Ban unhealthy products (ex. cigarettes, certain foods, etc.)
Divert some taxes into developing a better health care system for cities and counties
Our health care system must provide coverage to all people. It currently lacks the ability to do so.
The health care system must be affordable to all its users.
Emergency rooms should have the ability to attend all of its patients in a fast and productive way. It has been from experience that I have seen people wait hours before they are attended.
A possible way to make insurance more affordable is by having regulation over private insurance companies. Prices and coverage should be fair and regulated. This way it can prevent companies putting profits before their people.
Health insurance to our elderly should be guaranteed.
Their has been many cases where elderly have been miss treated our abused by their care keepers or even relatives. The people taking care of the elderly should be completely trained. Not only that, but the elderly should have an easy way of reporting these kinds of abuses. 
Emergency room visit it took 3 hours before being seen. They need to have faster service. It is called an emergency room for a reason.
Technology needs to be updated as quickly as possible it also needs to be ready at hand. Maybe each nurse can have a handheld device with the the notes instead of a chart that can be misplaced.
high schools should have like a life prep class about the things you encounter including life insurance. Kids come out of high school not knowing how to handle these situations
Certain labs and tests are too expensive for some people there need to be fairly equivalent alternatives for those who can't afford those labs and tests
I think long-term care such as nursing homes for the elderly is a good thing is most cases. As long as the health care providers take caution and know how to care for them. Being in a social environment is a good thing for those people in them.
Doctors should advise you which daily vitamins you should be taking to go along with the preventive care
In the emergency room there are too many people that come in and ask the same initial questions over and over when they could have spent less time asking those multiple times and looked at your chart or handheld device that could be updated efficiently it would take less time
The front desk staff could communicate for effectively with the patients on wait times and things like that so that they wouldn't get so frustrated with how long they have been sitting there. Maybe keep a screen with the waiting line if there is a more important case then it jumps. Have certain colors that identify which is more serious and needs attention sooner rather than later. I think the main issue about waiting is people want to be in the know about what is going on
Hospitals or late night clinics should have a pharmacy that is accessible to the patients so you can get the medicine while you are there for the visit and not have to go the pharmacy after waiting, getting examined, and then waiting to be released.
Maybe doctors that have a private practice should be required to spend one night a month in a hospital if we are short on doctors
There should be better payment plans in place to encourage people to pay their medical bills.
Before being allowed on Medicare or Medicaid, a class on the healthcare system should be required
This should be an option towards their accreditation and license approval
There should be more volunteer opportunities and internship.
Insurance companies should work with individuals better on knowing what their plans provide
Urgent care facilities should not have a general starting visit rate above $100
Medical education should be more affordable for all ages.
There shouldn't be such a difference in earned income between hospital physicians and private practice physicians
Maybe better access to health care for those who don't have or can't afford medical insurance
Insurance companies should require a health care class and not just a yearly physical
If Medicaid or Medicare is going to be denied to someone, other options should be suggested or offered
There should be a development of better health care programs for low to middle income families
People with higher education should have better consideration for health care than denial off their income.
There should be two groups of nurses on staff, one for life threatening and another for minor injuries
And should not be limited to an exam or treatment but their prescriptions as well
There needs to be better budgets in place and money raising ideas for funding of the technology, rather than denial because funding for technology is not available.
Would have to be HIPPA approved to avoid leaking personal information
Pharmacies should notify the patient before using an alternative to their prescription. ie using a generic instead of the original
There should be better follow up care instructions and guidelines
long term care facilities should be better accommodated to feel like a home and not a temporary hospital
Hospitals should have more health care information days.
Hospitals should be required by a federal law program to have up to date check in, check out, and on going care technology.
There should be better identification programs in place there is the ability to differentiate between adult twin medical records.
people should have better access to their own medical records.
Health care providers should be more open minded to patients questions and more prepared to answer.
This would mean there is better rotation programs and more understanding of human ability. A nurse who has 5 patients or more at once is only one person trying to assist one doctor who may be seeing 15 patients at that time.
Education programs should more state linked than diverse from state to state.
This is a class that should teach about all aspects of the healthcare system. From insurance, to not qualifying for insurance and other options, preventative care for long term, health care programs to help for any situation
there should be less restriction on income requirements for state provided healthcare
A universal health care system should be on back up so when a person checks into a hospital while on vacation, there isn't a stack of paperwork to fill out every time.
the same is for people with the same names
It must also be affordable to our elders
There should be more doctors and nurses on duty so the ER functions quicker
Make more generic brands for medications that are too expensive
Medical schools should offer more scholarships. Most students don't further their career in the medical field due to the fact that it costs too much money
Doctors should spend a little more time and advise their patients on preventative care
price gouging has become a problem with healthcare
doctors only care about the money and not the patients
medications are too expensive
I agree everyone is not fortunate enough to buy their own insurance
everyone gets sick the same and  bleed the same therefore healthcare should be affordable for everyone not just the people who can afford it at the time
more research needs to happen before  the healthcare system can change
there should be a time limit on waiting in the Emergency rooms
keeping accurate medical records should be mandatory
It will also help if emergency rooms were completely staffed, some hospitals only have the minimal amount of doctors working during certain times in order to reduce cost.
What if people are cant afford to pay? For example a low income family that has a member suffering from cancer, while you could help by providing smaller payments, but the costs are still going to be the same and the family is still going to be in debt.
Anyone can go to a new hospital where they don't have your previous medical records. There needs to be a program that all medical physicians use so that your medical records are accessible no matter where you go
Having them notify you would just delay the process that much longer
We could also just better staff the hospital, it`ll be more expensive for the hospital and overwhelming for the doctor if we keep them overnight.
That's why you would have colors to identify which case is more serious and you would use a number system to identify each patient. It would be the same as when they call out your name to take you back to your room
This is true, i have probably received 3 of the same shoots because the new hospitals I visited did not have my records. Patients are supposed to keep their own record, but these can be easily lost or misplaced.
I think they need to stop cutting back on staff for budget cuts and saving costs but take phone out of offices or go paperless. They need to cut the small things before they cut the major things
Hospitals should have more staffs
They also shouldn't assign 10 patients to one nurse
there should be alternatives of payment to patients who come from low income families
improve their installment plans
A hospital should have more doctors in the floor so the waiting time isn't as long
Make some generics more affordable. I've had to pay $200 for a generic medication once 
The elderly should have well trained certified care givers in order to be sure that they are not mistreated or abused
There should be a sharing type system that allows your new doctor to view your medical records from your old doctor
they could create a program to train hospital staff like every 3-6 months to make sure they know what they're doing
we actually have one of the worst healthcare systems but we can improve if everyone can come together to focus on more effective ways to make the system better
the health of the patients should be the top priority and not how much money one can make off the pateint
some people may feel not having insurance is better than actually having insurance these days because of the high cost
all birth control should be free. $50 dollars a month for a college-student or non college student is alot
there should be health classes offered on how to eat right and exercise
Or make better payment options through hospitals to help pay off their schooling.
This is also a problem because not having insurance also means people aren't paying for medical bills that can't be avoided. This creates higher premiums thru the hospitals and insurance companies.
People who don't have insurance should be able to claim their medical in a more itemized way on their taxes.
Most hospitals and physicians offices are more technologically advanced in being paperless but in order to be fully paperless would mean a reduction in hackers for identity theft and fraud purposes. A lot of hospitals don't cut the small cost because these costs don't add up the way the large budget cuts do. 
That is not always possible with single parents, special needs families, other personal conflicts, and also just lack of properly trained personnel to hire to fill the positions.
This is not entirely true due to the universal health care system that Obama is putting into place a lot of doctors were forced to enter that program because they do not make enough for their private services to survive.
When a patient makes an appointment and then must wait for an hour or more for service that then should reduce their cost for medical expenses. They have other things going on besides sitting in a doctor's office all day. Its wasting their opportunity to earn money while the doctor is taking money.
There needs to be more focus on teaching about preventative care and motivation for preventative care before problems arise rather than after an incident.
There needs to be more education on testing and cost of testing sexually transmitted infections and diseases.Or even where it can be done if a person doesn't have insurance for testing.
There should be more motivational incentives to help keep people eating healthy and working out regularly to stay in good shape.
maybe a good one would be having a universal system for every hospital where all of the patient`s information is stored and use only that one system or program.
I don`t believe taking phones out of hospitals or clinics would be a good idea. There is still a considerable amount of people that don`t have access to computers. But i do agree their is small things that should be cut.
I'm pretty positive they have to do continuing education to keep their license up to date which would be almost the same thing
Kroger offers two different types of Birth Control that are $9
As far a medicine is concerned there is always a different and cheaper option most people just don't take the time nor do they want to spend the effort to figure it out. Most medicine that is more expensive takes less time to take effect and kills whatever you have faster. People can't be so lazy when it comes to stuff like that
How could they keep up with this? And where would the budget come from to be able to pay for those incentives?
I agree with this 100% but when would we start teaching these types of things to people? I think the younger they are the better because then they don't start making bad habits. Habits are hard to break especially bad ones and if you are waiting till college to start them then it would be next to impossible to do anything about it.
I think the main problem with a lot of things is that we don't teach the kids at a younger age. We don't teach them about insurance, medical bills, health preventative care and more and we need to or it may not ever get any better.
From personal experience you can just the bare minimum on a medical bill. If you die before the medical bill is taken care of it goes to the next person in the family line. My grandmother paid $5 every month for years before it was passed down to my mom.
Personally I think that people think the rest of the world is out to get them. Just like with the whole not being able to pay your monthly medical bill. You don't have to pay a ton of money on it each month as long as you are paying something.  The world isn't out to get everyone they just need to educate themselves a little better and figure out what all of their options are. Not only do they need educate themselves but the health care system needs to offer better ways for people to educate themselves.
Not only should nurses and doctors have to pass all of their nursing exams I think they should have to pass a personality test to see what types of patients they should be allowed to work with
kids should be informed and taught about insurance
We should take measures on how to lower the percentage of teen pregnancy
lower the cost of birth control
Everyone should have access to Plan B. Maybe this can reduce the amount of teen pregnancy
Children should be educated more about health and diets. If they practice a healthy diet at a young age, childhood obesity can be prevented.
doctors should spend more time with their patients
I agree this is a great idea
I also agree with this statement, and it can also be free
I agree, kids are engaging in sexual activity alot younger these days
I agree, there should be more facilities that provide that option for STI's and etc.
there should also be some type of over the counter yeast infections pills in case the items on the shelf do not cure the problem
This would be great if you could get the teenagers more involved who are at more risk of it.
That may actually promote more teens to have sex because they know there is a back up in case a pregnancy may happen.
This would also be a great way to get more professional athletes involved to help kids understand that the healthy eating isn't a bad thing rather something to go along with the sports.
Pharmacies should have payments plans in place for those who can't afford medication because they have no insurance.
The community should come together more and rally for more rural clinics to help those who don't live within city limits.
Medical care such as Care Flight and ambulance care should not be as expensive as the actually hospital visit itself.
Bigger cities should have more health fairs, as in maybe 1 every 6 months, in order to help the lower income and or homeless to receive any medical attention they may be denied to income.
This is where some of tax dollars need to be going to, not only that but get the students more old school games. Also, get families involved in doing sports together such as family soccer games against other families. Do things that used to go on in the 80's and 90's where schools, churches, and communities came together to do sports and activities together for the bettering of the children.
This though may promote more stress on a child. Why do children need to understand at 9 and under about bills? I think this would possibly create more mental health problems for those children though it could also be a good way to keep them on the right path of working hard so they do not struggle like their parents do.
The only thing with this is some medical bills show a minimum payment and some months that minimum payment may be money they just don't have.
Unfortunately, a lot of times there are personality tests given to nurses and doctors but in time of crisis how can you say no you can't work with that patient because your personality will clash with theirs when you don't even have the time to evaluate the patient?
Hospital waiting rooms and information desk should offer monthly newsletters for the people of the hospital to see more of what is going on with in their hospital, such as new technology, new doctors, and or modification to hospitals policies or areas of the hospital
allow affordable insurance to self employed citizens
decrease in price in pharmaceuticals for retired or senior citizens
better coverage for emergency room services
do not mandate health insurance for everyone, let it be a personal choice to receive health care services
Make basic health care services available to everyone, such as cancer screening and other preventive services.
Establish a HealthCare system proper of a developed nation, as the Universal Healthcare systems used throughout Europe.
HealthCare system funding should come from tax revenue.
Pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies' interest should not be a priority in the new HealthCare system, emphasize on the service not on the business part of helthcare.
I think there should be more education about health care in High school and a college so that, by the time we graduate we can have a complete idea on what type of insurance to choose and which one who benefit us the most.
Europe and Asia have a better health care system than U.S because most of the insurance comes here, in U.S, are after money not the betterment of their customers
Technology can be used better to help people understand the basics of the healthcare system in America.
I think Obama has done a good job with his healthcare system
We pay taxes and we have the right to have a free health insurance
For the money we pay to the insurance companies, we need full insurance and for every incident.
If they were more response, they could have saved more lives
If there was better training, the response would be faster.
If taxes were higher, then we could allow free health care
If there was higher pay for medical response teams, there would likely be more people to be working for the profession. Meaning faster response times.
Better contracts need to be provided that allow fuller insurance plans.
Technology needs to be better explained to patients before they are used.
We need better health classes in general throughout middle to college, so people can take care of themselves more rather than having to depend on their yearly checkup.
Make yearly checkups available to everybody.
Make STI and pregnancy tests available to everybody.
Provide abortion care for a reasonable price. If we are paying for something, we should have access to it whether or not somebody else disagrees with it.

Increase funding for research about mental health
Provide easier ways for people to get help for their mental health issues.
Break the idea that depression is something simple and can be treated instantly.
Break the monopoly pharmaceutical companies have on medication to provide lower prices for needed medications.
Don't force people who don't have health insurance to break the bank to pay their medical bills.
Provide many different health care providers so people have a choice on what they want.
Allow zombie apocalypse to occur so then a good amount of the population no longer needs healthcare.
Or alien invasion.
Increase funding for NASA so better technology is created that could be used for medical use.
Provide easy way for people to get treatment for drug addiction.
Or alcoholism.
Provide better healthcare for veterans with PTSD.
Provide cancer treatment for free
Provide all treatment for free, screw survival of the fittest.
Make money less of a priority, think about the patient first.
Legalize Euthanasia, people deserve to be able to choose when they die, keep religion out of medicine.
Legalize medical marijuana in all states. The only reason it's illegal was because of racism 20-30 years ago.
Make medical marijuana easily accessible to everybody. Have a headache? Here's some weed.
Allow stem cell research, why it's not being studied enough I don't understand.
Allow cloning, if I want to have a copy of myself to clean and cook, that's my problem.
Seriously, cooking and cleaning, and maybe doing my homework. That would be amazing.
I believe a decrease in prices for medicine would help them afford the medicine they need.
I agree with this statement I believe that they should offer free mandatory college courses for the health care system and how it works. Graduating without knowledge of the health care system would leave students clueless about it.
Most companies that provide insurance should offer free insurance because most people can't afford to pay for every accident that happened.
Local Doctors should be in areas where patients are needed.
Make yearly checkups free in order for everyone to know what's wrong with their health.
Depression can't be treated that easily. Doctors should provide free treatment.
Health insurance should be free to individuals with low income, but also have a reasonable price for people with high levels of income.
Use television ads, post flyers, and email people about mental health.
Stop selling drugs in stores or monitor where the drugs are coming from.
provide incentives for people who live a healthy lifestyle
allow virtual doctor visits to save time and money(video chat)
make schools healthier to start a healthier lifestyle young and set a good example for the future
make no room for diagnostic mistakes because that is costing millions in unnecessary medications
or reward those who are living healthy lifestyles
deny extra aid for smokers
require an exercise program for type 2 diabetes patients, it will improve their health dramatically and save of medical costs
I think smokers should be given more aid and should be sent interventions so they can get out of their smoking habits and live a healthy life.
Use technology to educate younger kids about healthcare
I have no idea about Obama care or medic aid or any of the medical stuff. If government takes responsibility to help me know what all the stuff is then I would be so much better off
Health care providers need to step up their activities in communities and increase awareness
I wish we had that technology
We have this technology, people are just nervous about it
Emergency room coverages should be free.
Stop selling cigarettes in general, there is no point to them anymore. They don't make people feel good, they just harm more than good.
I want a cookie every time my dentist says my teeth are good.
Create technology that allows doctors to preform tests on a patient to make sure they are healthy.
Virtual doctors with video chat would be a problem because actual doctors are needed to perform treatment to individuals.
No point, the drugs will be sold on black market. Rather, increase awareness about drug abuse and give easy access to those who wish to have help.
Start using nuclear energy, fossil fuels cause people to choke and die.
Ban cigarettes, they cause people to choke and die
Provide programs to get children aware of living a healthy lifestyle for their future. Have the board of education become aware this and ask the government to create programs for this.
Make glues that are as useful as normal glue, but does not have anything added that when sniffed could cause harm to people. Then, ban all other forms of glue.
Stop making false diagnostics so people stop wasting money on medication.
Stop using nuclear energy. Use natural energy to create generators to keep people in hospitals alive such as wind and solar powered equipment or generators.
Make medication cheaper, I mean seriously, $300 for a pair of glasses?
Raise the price of cigarettes to prevent people with low incomes from buying it.
Speed up STD results. Somebody could contract and STD, go in for an STD checkup, have unprotected sex, and THEN receive their results. That could suck for the other person.
Have insurance companies provide cheaper rate plans so people won't have to worry about paying too much for their medical bills or have insurance companies provide free insurance for lower and middle class individuals.
Make condoms that make protected sex more enjoyable. I mean seriously, I can't feel anything, at all
Make pet medication cheaper, I love dogs, but they are freakin expensive.
I mean seriously, my trip to the doctor, which included scans, cost less than my dogs vet bill.
Make it difficult for doctors to screw up. They are still people, and of course you want your life to be saved, but mistakes can happen, but if there's a way to limit those mistakes, let's do that.
Give free exercise programs for people with diabetes.
Also a visit to the dietician/nutritionist mandatory to those who are prone to diabetes and/or heart decease.
It's definitely a good start. Since the world is watching how the US handles this problem of not having an established healthcare system, it should only get better. 
People with a strong addiction would still buy them. They should show some pictures on cigarette packaging showing how it affects the lungs, mouth, and teeth. 
allow affordable preventive care for people who have diabetes or any other disease in the family
educate americans on their health and nutrition
Technology can also be used to inform people on better health and nutrition choices
Instead of showing junk food commercials to kids and show healthier food alternatives instead, emphasizing on making the healthier choice.
So should this healthcare system be free to low income and middle class, and have a fee for those that don't qualify? But making preventive care available to everyone.
It is safe to say that Almost everyone in the US has access to the internet, either through public libraries, school, or smart phones, so people should do a little research about how to stay healthy not wait on what the government tells them what is healthy and what is not.
Include dental plan in healthcare system, if not free, then for a reasonable price.
People who begin a healthier lifestyle or loose weight under the healthcare system should pay less for healthcare coverage.
Make being obese a social stigma
Maybe make obese concentration camps. Once their BMI gets below obese, they can leave.
Destroy the current healthcare system and start up a new, free one.
Ban cigarettes by burning tobacco.
Start the bionic program. I want to be a robot by 2020.
Did somebody say immortality? Somebody should find the fountain of youth, no more need for healthcare at that point.
Give aid to smokers so they can be cured.
Stop telling people to use mouthwash, all it does is make your mouth burn. It does not clean teeth, nor does it make your breath smell good for more than a hour. Just brush your teeth and floss, that's all you need. 
Provide free condoms at local drug stores, but have an I.D presented before they pick it up.
Oh hey, we're on at the same time. It's not a cure that they need, it's the self-resolution to stop smoking.
Why an ID? Nobody is going to choke somebody to death with a condom. Allow anybody at any age to buy condoms. Safe sex is the best sex.
Have doctors provide a free diagnostics sample for the first few weeks of the medication and if it works for their health, have them continue to take the medication.
Start injecting a substance that turns bone into metal, yet still has the same effect as normal bones. That way, impossible to break your bone.
Allow people to look at the results the doctor got and force the doctor to explain in detail what the stats mean. That way, people can decide on their own whether or not the medication they need is the one they are offering.
Produce medications that make people immune to nuclear fallout. That way, if a nuclear apocalypse happens, nobody will be dying from the fallout, juuust the explosion. And the wind.
Offer free vaccinations for all diseases.
Cure AIDs already. We know you have the money to fund research, do it already. Also, cure cancer while you're at it.
or symbiot like venom from spiderman.
Psh, nah man, that would be way too slow. An alien invasion, however, can glass planets. A symbiot would be stuck to a single city.
Have the healthcare system charge a price of $1.00 - $10.00 for a dental plan depending on income.
$5 checkup? Take that subway.
Then everyone would be superhuman.
Works for me.
Have students studying to become doctors have stricter study schedules and internships available at all times.
More money into research could be really helpful. We can find cure for Aids and other incurable diseases 
Yes, North Korea is threatening to bomb us. Some kind of vaccination will be really helpful.
Lets try to get ourselves into a good shape. Eating healthy, going to the gym, outdoor sports. If the government can put some camps up throughout the year; it would be helpful.
Dentists are so expensive!
Grow tobacco for other uses, stop making cigarettes
Lets educate people, let them know how the healthcare system works
First cure the real health problems, then we can think about becoming a superhuman
What is Obamacare? how does it even work. If there was something that could help me educate, i would be better off
Emergency services have been very pro-active during the Boston Marathon bombings and Waco Fertilizer explosion.
you should be able to pay what you can afford
the higher income the better health care services
surgeries and operations should not be as expensive so the average person can afford them
mentally ill people should have a cheaper insurance because they'll need it a lot more
and physically disabled
free health care services for college students on campus
medicine shouldn't be so expensive
free refills on prescriptions
nursing homes need to make sure their nurses are taking good care of the patients
people should be able to create their own health carer plan
all schools wheel chair accessible
that would be more convenient for most people
the health industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, they do not want people getting healthier, if most people are healthy, then who will buy their dangerous side effect pills?  in order to end a lot of illness, there should be a focus on what is really causing a certain illness and treating that, not masking it with a pill that in the long run will make the person more ill and possibly kill them. 
a big focus should be in preventive care, most of the illnesses that people are facing today can be prevented
there should be more education about medical procedures and surgeries, for example, some operations that cost a lot of money are not really necessary, but the individual may feel that he or she does not have a choice, so they go through with it and end up in high debt.  sometimes doctors won't say anything because thousands of dollars to their bank accounts would do them no harm. 
the main thing that people should focus on is staying active, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, getting their regular exams done by their doctors, etc.  as opposed to what the focus is right now, which is just taking all types of medications and living an unhealthy lifestyle in general.  the health and fitness industry is very misleading though, so there should be an increase in education so people can rule out the false information.   
in regards to emergency room services, sometimes patients are forced to leave before time from the hospital by doctors, especially if the patients do not have insurance, this can lead to the patients suffering from further illnesses.  that needs to be addressed. 
insurances can be very misleading, sometimes people pay insurance companies for years only to find out that when they need the insurance it does not cover them for whatever reason.  knowledge is surely power when it comes to things like that.  education is key so people know what exactly are they paying for. 
developing new technology to improve health can benefit (and will benefit) a lot of people.  according to the news, $100 million will be used to study the brain, so hopefully we can learn more about it, since it's very important and we can also be able to prevent and cure diseases such as Alzheimer and other types of mental illness.
people should work to earn healthcare benefits
students should have some health benefits
some patients can get even sicker from hospitals. we should take more precautions in cleaning hospitals
nursing homes should have nurses that love and respect patients
universal health care should not be available in the US because people who do not work already depend on welfare. If universal health care is passed, then these people would also depend on that
we should make more jobs in the healthcare industry because people are always going to be sick.
health care workers should be paid more
calorie labels in fast food and restaurant chains should be mandatory so that people will know what they are eating
maintaining your physical well-being is important. everyone should eat healthy and exercise to prevent obesity, heart diseases, etc.
It is important that we make our children exercise instead of just letting them watch tv all day
everyone should have an opportunity/right to receive health care
medication shouldn't be expensive, it should have a price that that person can afford
to have the ambulance come to your home shouldn't be expensive
everyone isn't able to afford health care so there should be an alternative to receiving it
nursing homes need much better care, a lot of people in this world don't want their parents, grandparents, etc. to go to a nursing home because the nurses don't take care of the patients and do what they're supposed to do.
more people would be able to afford health care
because of that reason, people don't want to send their parents/grandparents/etc. to nursing homes
if the price of insurance was based on income, that might make the world a better place and make the situation fair
or free health care for all who receive an education from any accredited school
only do procedures that are necessary
people have to remember that everybody isn't able, everybody doesn't live a lavish life, everybody doesn't have money coming in like that, everyone should receive some type of health care to promote the well-being of Americans
taking care of ourselves prevents a lot of problems
technology plays a major role in health care
doctors and nurses need to have a passion for their work/job, some are just there for the money
Adding onto this, I think that employers should provide health care services of some sort to all regular employees. Ideally the government would provide a basic, low-cost health care service to all citizens while employers included better (possibly more advanced/higher coverage) plans in addition to it.
To improve general health care, I think that First Aid/general medical knowledge classes outside of biology should be taught in public schools. If students/citizens had a clearer grasp on basic medical conditions/treatments, health care services would be relied on less as a crutch. Along with this, as an idea, household treatments could be discussed in these classes. (such as gargling salt water for a sore throat instead of pumping more money into pharmacies for prescriptions)
If there were a way to ensure that a person could afford medical services with a ratio proportionate to their income, this would be fantastic. What if there were an option on tax forms (or somewhere convenient where everyone has the opportunity to) where it gives the option to donate towards lower income surgeries?
It is common knowledge that corporate employees of a business make literally hundreds of times more than scantily paid lower-level employees. With that in mind, what if there were a maximum wage employed to go alongside the minimum wage? With a more equally distributed propagation of profits, more people could afford more. Why struggle more than we have to? The monster that stands in the way is greed. Anyway... Ideally, CEOs would still make enough of their share to afford their extra cake/comfortability while entry-level employees would actually be able to afford the health care the companies boast about offering. If there were some type of ratio that limited how much a business owner could make versus a cashier, I'd be for it. Example: At a time, Ben and Jerry's ice cream company had a 7 to 1 ratio. (The numbers off the top of my head might not be exact, but it is the point that matters.) At any time, the owners could only make seven times more than the lower workers. That certainly beats other more common CEOS that make 578 times more than their wage slaves who sweat for $7.25 today.
If medical/dental students' curriculum/credits were required working in university-funded clinics more widely for training, practice, and cheap community charity, it could be used as a tool for lower income families to access a lower level of health care (even a cheaper one) that they otherwise wouldn't have a chance to receive.
medical school should be cheaper and more scholarships available. professors who teach in medical school should be paid more encouraging them to properly educate the students
improving the public's knowledge about how to stay fit
the hospital is just trying to make money so the person getting an operation should research for themselves if it is necessary for them to live
health care plans should be taught in high school. i have no idea about any aspect of it
nor a helicopter, you can't help that you're in critical condition
More useful everyday skills should be requirements to be taught in school. (Budgeting, balancing checkbooks, automotive, how to apply for jobs, writing resumes/cover letters, insurance, self-medical care, etc.)
Revising the FDA's "ideal" food pyramid is more than necessary. It becomes clearer and clearer to nutritionists that animal-derived products that contain such high fat, sodium, and added hormones do not improve human health. Less emphasis should be made on meat and dairy portions while vegetables and nuts should be considered more of main staples. (It is sadly not uncommon to come across a person who claims they "don't like", "hardly", or "almost never eat vegetables".) Some of the most common health problems are faced by Americans are heart conditions which can often in part be traced back to high meat and fat consumption.
Factory farms should become outlawed. If animal-derived products are to be consumed, it should overall be on a lesser scale and certainly without added hormones, cruelty, and filthiness of factory farms. For example, the average factory farmed chicken after hormones and antibiotics is fattened to multiple times what its natural weight would be. It eventually is forced to grow so large that its legs can no longer support its body. Studies have shown that the consumption of chickens like this have detrimentally affected the physical development of pubescent girls, causing them to start menstrual cycles as early as 8 years old and in addition, develop breasts early. At the very least, even if factory farms are not outlawed, the undercover investigations done about them should be broadcasted in news. PSAs should be developed to lessen usage of animal products or to promote vegetarianism for health.
everyone should receive some type of education some how on health care because I have no idea what it's about either
they should change the high school curriculum so that its more beneficial for students after graduation
  That would be great, it would be a win-win situation for the students because they get to practice and build more confidence in what they're doing, and the patients can benefit from receiving a service at a much lower cost than what is normally paid. 
more services for the elderly like "meals on wheels" when individuals come to the elderly home, give them their meal, and check on them
That's true, and after a short period of working they experience burnout and are not even doing their best in regards to properly caring for their patients.  They like the yearly salary, but working with people is truly not their thing. 
technology could play a major role in preventing illnesses, diseases, etc. it wont fully eliminate it, but it would probably reduce it
if anyone is sick, whether they have insurance or not, they should be able and have the right to receive emergency room services
anybody working with people, regardless if it's in a nursing home, hospital, doctor's office, etc., should make sure that that is what they truly want to do.  it is unfortunate that at times the people that you depend on to take care of a loved one, or even yourself, do not even like what they do, totally hate their job, and might even mistreat the patients.  what's the point of making good money while working in a place which does not suit you? 
changing the policy on having to pay a "co pay" when you go to the doctors
and somehow provide education on health care because there's hundreds of people who don't know anything about health care
it is amazing how there are simple cures for many illnesses, things that can be found in our homes, not in a pharmacy, can help us eliminate an illness.  modern medicines just mask the symptoms, the illness doesn't really go away. 
a lot of people lose sight of what the true goal (supposedly) of the medical field is, which is to help people.  all they think about is the yearly salary that they are going to make, the things that they are going to buy with that money, the prestige that comes with having a title such as Dr., etc. but when it comes time to work with the patients they may not even put a good effort to help them and this can lead to the patients suffering the consequences for their negligence.   
people who work should have more benefits than those who don't
doctors should spend more time with their patients. they usually see them for only a few minutes every day. I feel like some doctors only want to get their job done and do not care enough for their patients
schools should require flu shots so that there is a less likely chance for it to spread throughout campus
hand sanitizer dispensers available everywhere so the public can have easy access to them.
everyone should be able to maintain a healthy diet so that they will not risk heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, etc.
universal healthcare would mean that we would have to pay more taxes
parents should be more responsible for the well being of their child. this means that they should have their children eat healthier foods and exercise daily to prevent being obese
we should not increase medicare because people on medicare depend too much on it.
more generic brands should be offered for prescriptions so that they will not cost as much.
It is important that we fund more on technology because it plays a big role in our health.
Some people do not know what their insurance covers so it is important that everyone should learn about it
Insurance companies sometimes scam their customers.
prescriptions are sometimes too expensive and some people cannot afford them
surgeries can cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars and no average middle class American has that kind of money.
if people maintain a healthy diet and exercise on a daily basis, then there would be no need for extra medications
prescription drugs shouldn't be expensive, I think they are 10x the rate in the UK and Germany
Being in the hospital is also very expensive because prescription drugs are expensive, to come to the hospital because you're ill shouldn't cost an arm and a leg.
the American health care system is too expensive and people should be able to afford it and everyone should have a right to receive health care, it's like $100 more in the US than other countries such as France, Canada, and Spain.
there are many many people who don't know anything about the health care system and how it works, everyone should receive some type of education or knowledge about it.
I agree, I think all schools should require flu shots, that would help the situation very much.
everyone should receive the same amount of health care services, but the price of insurance and things like that should be determined by your income.
to make the American health care system fair, you should be able to pay for things according to your income.
a lot of food contains gmo's which are very harmful for our health.  a lot of illnesses originate due to the body's constant exposure to gmo's.  there should be more education in regards to proper nutrition and lifestyle.  when it comes to health, the government isn't always the one to go to for help because money controls everything, and food companies that produce products or raise livestock that contain gmo's are billion-dollar businesses that by law do not have to tell the consumer what they put in their products.  basically, they are protected from harm, even though they are the ones contributing to the general population's harm.
i agree, proper healthcare should start in the home.  the parents need to be educated as well though, because a lot of times they'll go by what they were taught and at times that is not correct.
that would help a lot of people because at times one still has to pay something for a medical procedure and paying something reasonable, in regards to their income, is more convenient than paying a price that is way more than what that person can make in years of working. 
spreading knowledge about what an individual can do in certain situations, can help save a life and also prevent unnecessary costs.  for example, there are instances in which accidents occur and even though bystanders may want to help the people involved, they may not know how to and by the time the paramedics arrive at the scene some of the people affected by the accident may be in a worse condition than what they already were.   
professionals that help people transition from the hospital to their homes should be well prepared and the doctors should listen to what they have to say in regards to the client's health, and whether discharging them from the hospital may be a good idea or not at the moment. 
if an individual, doctor or nurse, makes a medical error and it results in the death of a patient, that person should be punished heavily. the higher consequences would make the health care providers extra careful when treating patients
the way we get our meat supplies is unhealthy. more people should shop at farmers markets and buy organic foods
eat less sugars. once we quit craving something sweet it will be easier to eat healthy and more vegetables
mental institutes should feel more like home than a prison
medical school should not be as expensive so that more students can have an equal opportunity to go to school and come out not in so much debt :)
No person can be 100% perfect all the time. In these situations, I'm sure the people punish themselves more than any other outside factor could. Instead of "punishing heavily", why not focus on re-training instead of potentially losing heavily educated/trained hands in a hospital?
Create higher standards for meat and vegetable production. Actually enforce that these rules are stuck to with (most importantly) regular inspections. There are very few laws in place to protect animals that are aimed for slaughter. This affects everyone that supports the industry as well as the livestock. Shrinking factory farms to create more space for wheat/vegetables/greens that use less water, land, and financial resources would help with health, business expenses, product prices and deforestation.
Why not create free/cheap community classes for this? Think first aid/CPR/emergency preparedness classes held at schools, gyms, community centers, or church-type places. Maybe organizations like the Red Cross could teach them.
Yes!
some hospitals give care that is unnecessary for patients and therefore will make their hospital bill higher
children should be taught more on how to eat healthy and how it is going to benefit your health
patients should be informed of what their health care plan covers
preventive care is one of the most important focus on the issue. if you have a heart operation, it will cost thousands of dollars. however, if you manage to take care of your health and reduce the risk of heart disease, you will not have to spend that money
gym memberships should not be so expensive.
people are sometimes too lazy to go work out so it is important that we exercise daily to prevent the risk of heart disease.
everyone should keep track of how many calories they should consume in one day.
Emergency rooms sometimes provide unnecessary care for patients if they find out they do not have insurance.
health care providers should be paid well, along with good benefits.
I agree. Some people who do not work depend on medicare to provide for their healthcare needs while some who work do not get a lot of benefits. If we have health care services based on income, then this will improve the health care system.
Medicaid needs to be reformed to help people get off of it, by slowly taking people off of the program instead of all at once
insurance needs to be more affordable and better coverage
private pay should not be way less than if you pay for the doctors visit with insurance. to have to pay high monthly premiums and then pay high deductibles at the doctors place is draining peoples money
health care professionals should care more about the patients, and not how many patients they will see in one day
preventive care should be taken more seriously because it is cheaper to prevent than to cure, but most people can afford it so they have to wait till its more serious and then go to the doctor to get care , so they should bring down the cost of preventive care
instead of prescribing antibiotics all the time doctors should look for the true source of the problem, that will save money for everybody
the government should not impose a penalty for someone without insurance because they are the reason it cost so much and people cant afford it, taxes pay for the people on Medicaid but the people without anything are left without any help and have to pay it back on their own, they need to stop throwing money at Medicaid and start thinking of ways to get people independent
the public should be more educated about healthcare and their health in general so that they can make better decisions about where they should go and what they should do
parents need to be better informed of the options out there
It should start in the schools, the children need to be better informed so when they are adults they can make better decisions
getting a loan specific for medical bills should be easier, they should only work if its medical, not cosmetic or for buying anything else. and they should not have interest rates for the first 6 months to a year, after that a very low one so that the people can pay off their medical bills faster
People should stop assuming all old people need help and then raising the prices for them or making it harder for them to get surgeries, the ones who really need the help or surgery should be able to get it, not have to jump thew hoops
doctors should not get big bonuses for taking insurances, like medicaid or medicare, they over do work so they can get paid from the government and then ultimately it hurts the people
more money needs to be spent on preventing Cancers, Alzheimer's, and things like, in the end if we can prevent some of these damaging things it will cost less and save a lot of lives
doctors should charge the same price for a doctors visit
cosmetic surgery should cost more than an emergency surgery- the people that do cosmetic surgery do it willingly and should have the money saved up for it, but the people who get in accidents should be charged less because they did not chose to have that happen to them
doctors should not be able to discriminate against an emergency surgery or cosmetic surgery- if the emergency one cost less they should have to treat it the same as they always did
the doctors should get benefits if they handle emergency cases not cosmetic ones
pharmaceutical companies should not be able to entice a doctor into using their product by promising them things, the doctors should use the drug because it works and is safe, and has gone threw all the procedures by the FDA with blind testing and things
insurance should not be forced on everyone if it is going to put them out of work or lessen their hours because it'll only harm them in the long run with less money and no insurance.
drug companies should not be competing with each other to sell more product, if the medicine is the same it shouldn't be marketed as different medications
lifesaving surgeries and surgeries that will make someone's life more livable (not cosmetically but for health reasons) should not cost an arm and a leg.
the government should spend more money on preventive medicine and education in schools so that people won't have to suffer the consequences later
there should be requirements that health professionals offer their services free of charge for at least one organization to help those who are too poor in our country
there should be regulations on the amount a doctor can charge a patient for how many tests they are given for diagnosis. and if in the end the patient did not need the test, they should not be charged for it
more money should be focused on spreading information to people about how to care for their bodies and general hygiene. especially to new parents and caretakers of the elderly.
research for cures should be consolidated and not spread out over various companies, the health and lives of the people are more important than the possible monies the companies are competing for.
yearly vaccines should be made affordable, and prices should be limited for those who have large families and small pay
the government should make every effort to extinguish the profit drug companies and research organizations are vying for in order to stop bribes that are made to health professionals-who endorse medicine for the wrong reasons.
emergency rooms should be treated as emergencies and doctors and nurses should be properly staffed to quickly and efficiently care for these patients instead of making them wait for hours while the staff does paperwork
the staff should get less pay instead of more pay for making patients wait. the government should make it mandatory that treatment be given even if insurance paperwork has not gone through (yet). money can be worried about later especially if its less expensive
health staff should not be told about a patient's salary or insurance level because it may interfere with their bed side manner
bedside manner needs to learned and made a necessary requirement for graduating med school/nursing school/or any other health school
the government needs to make health education for future doctors/nurses/and other healthcare providers less expensive, because we have shortages that make well staffed hospitals in cases or emergencies rare.
we need to be able to reach out to more people
more money should be focused on an equal distribution throughout health care
doctors should be taught to take more holistic approaches and strive to find affordable yet effective ways to help their patients.
doctors should be taught to take more holistic approaches and strive to find affordable yet effective ways to help their patients.
health care coverage should be reevaluated and should only cover essentials as to not cover so much and make us pay more
it's important that we educate people all over the spectrum so that they are aware and can make more beneficial choices/decisions when it concerns health care. also it would help them be able to figure out what the best plan is for them so that they won't have to over or under pay.
we should be able to provide thing needed in preventive care within the health care policy/insurance so that we can help prevent future high spending on health
more/better health care preventative classes in schools and communities
Hire more insurance employees to weed out those who take advantage of the system
doctors should not be influenced by outside sources such as politics and industrial companies
the people with the least income should have the highest "benefit" from government run insurance companies such as Medicaid and Medicare
government funded health care should only be given to those who want it
more clinics should be opened throughout communities to prevent unnecessary expensive emergency room visits
there should not be a competition between healthcare facilities
health care needs to be fixed to save everyone money all around, the facilities and patients
everyone deserves equal treatment regardless of income or insurance benefits
There should be some type of healthcare for everyone.
A general and affordable insurance plan should be made available to every citizen of the US; it might be costly, but everyone needs some sort of healthcare.
I know that providing healthcare to everyone may seem skeptical because a lot of people would abuse the system, however the government should perform drug tests to the people who claim they need healthcare just to make sure the right amount of healthcare is being given to the appropriate people.
everyone needs a clinic that is nearby. sometimes, people with emergencies don't have enough time to make it to the ER.
There would have to be a set price. Visiting the doctor because you have the flu versus because you have allergies would not be a fair price.
It should be given to those who need it too, whether they ask for government assistance or not.
I don't think it should depend on income.
I agree. Health care should also be fixed to where wealthy people can also benefit.
The care and health of patients should be number one priority instead of how much money physicians and other healthcare providers will make off of them in a day.
There should be a more natural way to cure illnesses other than always using medication.
Very true. Not very many people are educated health-wise. Health programs and lectures should be given in the workplace to employers and employees no matter where they work. This should be a part of orientation when someone begins a new job.
This world revolves around money. Elderly people should be able to have easier access to healthcare. They are more prone to diseases, illnesses, and many other things.
Healthcare and what's behind healthcare such as financials and types of insurance should be taught in high schools throughout the US. It would be very useful and something very helpful students could utilize in their futures; they could pass on the information to others as well.
Cosmetic surgery should not even exist unless it is done in the circumstances of malformation of the face or any other body part, or if in a car accident, and something happened to the physical appearance of a person. In other words cosmetic surgery should only be used to return physical appearances back to normal.
That is true. Doctors should be more concerned with the health of their patients, rather than making some great money-making deal with some company.
Not only do Americans need to speak up to change the healthcare system, but healthcare providers should too.
A lot of people could take advantage of this though, if they are not required to pay promptly. They could prolong and keep prolonging the time to pay for their visit and end up never paying at all. The US could lose a lot of money.
Exactly my point! There are several people who take advantage of the healthcare system and there should be a specific career just for ruling out those who are truly in need of healthcare versus those who are just playing the system.
The doctor would loose to much money if they did that. Then the cost for everybody would go up.They can offer them at cheaper prices and then have easy payment plans.
And then the regular people would be the ones that would suffer from the higher prices the doctors would have to then use.
The cosmetic surgery brings in a lot of money, it should cost more and some of the benefits should go back to the people.
In a true emergency the staff does not wait for the paper work to process they start working on the patient right away. If you are in there on the weekend with a cold having to wait is not a big deal. The reason you are waiting is because they have other people in there with guns shot wounds, heart attack, or car accident. The life threatening emergencies ALWAYS come first
Just because its holistic doesn't mean its less expensive
They already have the highest "benefit" from the government that's why it cost us so much. I'm paying for mine and their healthcare needs. The government should find a way to lower the cost of healthcare while still managing to keep the care the same. That way I'm not paying for the person to lazy to get a job and pay for their own healthcare
Amen!!!
The people on drugs are not going to be the only problem with that, the women with 50 kids can find away to cheat the system. The problem is the people who really need the help don't get it, and the people who don't really need the help find all the loop holes and exploit the system
Just because the elderly are at a higher chance of not making it through surgeries or treatments or having a long life to look ahead to, does not mean that hospitals should pass over them to give organs or treatments to those who are more likely to live longer
But a variation of this would help to keep doctors from asking for multiple tests that they know have nothing to do with the patients' illnesses
Yes. The government has seriously overpriced everything in the healthcare field and now trying to make it less expensive will always cost the US money. this is not to say that the patient will never have to pay and can keep prolonging it, but that it shouldn't be an issue at that moment.
new technologies should not be a privilege that needs to be earned by each hospital, hospice, clinic. they should be made more readily available for patients' sakes.
when dealing with people with mental health issues, healthcare staff needs to have more than a basic understanding for the patient and their own safety. the staff need to trained to remain professional and treat them as any other person and not try to cast them off as crazy
that doesnt mean they also dont need health care.
this is to ensure that one does not have to pay too much for healthcare. only if it's needed.
steps need to be taken to validate the needs of the patients versus the wants as to prevent losing product and money on someone who wants it as opposed to someone who needs it.
everyone needs to have a vocal opinion over their position with healthcare and how they see it.
agreed, if there is no health benefit to cosmetic surgery, then it should not be an option.
healthcare professionals need to be thoroughly trained in order to be able to do their job in the best way possible. therefore, standards of hiring and education need to be higher in order to ensure only the best are on the job.
we need to educate people about ways they can take care of themselves naturally to help avoid the need for many pharmaceuticals.
competition should be squashed to a minimum and we need to really research and figure out the true and best benefits of different medications.
availability of such clinics should be encouraged.
I agree, This would also save money all around.
I agree there are too many people who abuse the system and make it worse for people who really need the benefits.
I think that if the US created a program or government system like Canada (everyone having healthcare, but also having to pay higher taxes), it would solve most of the problems in health care today. It would eliminate outside insurance but offer everyone healthcare at the same time, provoking equality in the healthcare system.
I think that if someone wants to get cosmetic surgery they should be able to, but at their own expense.
If more money was put into diagnostics it would save time and money (in the long run). It would save patients money by not having to buy unnecessary medicine and make multiple hospital trips, and save the time of the doctors by producing a higher turnover rate (seeing more patients).
Nursing-intended students and physician-intended student go to school for a very long time to achieve a degree. Classes for them should be less-expensive.
Instead of advising patients to take medication, they should be advised to take vitamin, eat healthier foods, and exercise constantly. Patients save money and increase the longevity of their lives by doing this.
That's true. It's like patient advocacy is no longer top priority; however, if having to earn equipment is the case, then I guess healthcare providers better work their butts off to earn them. No, it's not fair that healthcare providers have to earn special equipment, but if that's how it is, then might as well try to make the best of it for the patient.
I agree. But if this were set to action, then I think doctors would be much more careful on what tests they would administer to the patients, thus saving themselves money and the patient money; it's a win-win situation.
All healthcare providers should be educated during their schooling about psychiatric patients. It is important to be able to read people and what their intentions are.
A healthcare provider cannot tell the future; they don't know how long a person will live. Yes, they can estimate that one person will live longer than another, but there is no way of telling what will happen to the patient, therefore they should not favor giving an organ to a younger, healthier person over an older, non-healthy person.
Having to pay higher taxes would also mean less money in U.S. households, therefore leading to lower income class all around.
There should be more action taken from the government to better healthcare.
this should be made mandatory education for elementary, middle schools, and high schools. the sooner kids learn how to take care of their health the less health problems they will have in the future.
the government should stop focusing so much money efforts on things that are not for the wellbeing of the population, and focus instead on the health of its citizens not the profits or glory they can receive.
by stopping health problems from occurring early on they will actually be saving money from having less serious complications from developing, which can boost the economy
there should be thorough education for anyone who gets pregnant, has a baby, or adopts/fosters-on how to keep the baby healthy. and what signs to watch out for, this would help to decrease the amount of hospital visits from new parents who may think every cough is a bad thing, and to avoid simple illnesses that could've been avoided.
Agreed, we should work towards preventing illness so that we don't have to deal with the expenses of curing illness.
Education of new parents is really important; especially when it comes to taking care of their children and even teaching upon them healthy lifestyles.
People need to be more informed and educated about the economy and what's going on so that they can have more of a voice when it comes to things that they have to pay for, such as health care. They need to have an opinion and be able to decide on such health care policies and ideas that would help benefit them and the rest.
Very true. Students need to learn early so that they can build up their ideas and their opinions for when they can have a choice.
I think it's important that the health facilities have access to quality tools such as technology. If we want it to be more available to patients, then we should start within their local health care centers.
Health care needs to have more specific policies that would fit individual people's needs. If there's a family of 3 or a family of 17, there should be different and specific policies and/or insurances that can cover them on what they need in ways that are affordable and essential.
A more strict and specific structure needs to be made.
Everyone needs healthcare, so there should be different types made for different people!
I agree the doctors should not get bonuses for taking specific insurances, they should take the insurance so they can help more people.
we have different healthcare plans and providers now, they just don't work. they need to find a plan that will save money and help the people.
We need those who enforce health care, and we need those who enforce fair treatment.
The trauma centers should be better educated to help the injured that come in. they need to make sure that the doctors they are staffing are qualified. we recently dealt with a doctor who was not very educated in his field, that is unacceptable.
Equal treatment of all patients should be a priority.
I feel that the focus should be more on youth, like newborns to toddlers, because they are just as prone to illness and disease as the elderly.
that would take a lot of money to get the people qualified to weed out the bad seeds and then ultimately the people will find away to get around the rules like they always do, and then the money used to train the people would be wasted.
All ER rooms should have the same equipment in them, and doctors need to be trained on how to properly check someone out after they have been in a wreck. the doctors in Eastland Texas missed 6 broken vertebrae, 2 broken ribs, and a shoulder injury because the doctors there either didn't have the right equipment or they are not qualified ER doctors.
Personal health lifestyles should be majorly emphasized to everyone! I personally believe it should be taught at BIRTH! Prevention is essential to have a less expensive health toll in the future.
the insurance companies should not charge the elder more for there premiums just because they are old.
Insurances should not charge more for a child of a women who is considered "high" risk for cancer. They jack the prices up because of the mom and that should not happen the child may never have any problems.
I remember when insurances actually made sense to have, if you had insurance you paid less for your meds and at the doctors office. now if you are private pay you pay less for your prescriptions than someone with insurance. and sometimes the doctors visits are less expensive
Old people homes should be full of people who love what they do, to many times you hear of someone abusing the elderly who live there or stealing from them. there needs to be a better way to get these people out of there or not in there in the first place. they should get harsher punishments for abusing them to discourage other people from doing it
Pharmaceutical companies should not be aloud to make promises or incentives to the doctors to get them to  use there products, the drugs should be used because they work.
there should not be patents on medicines that are new that last for 10 years, there should be a generic version out sooner than that so people can afford to get the medicine that they need
I agree! Preventive care is the best care.
the schools need to serve better food to our children so they can develop the good eating habits they will need as adults.
of course they first learn in the home, but some children eat 2 meals at school so having healthy and nutritious food to give them will be better for everybody.
I agree, my grandmother used to stay in an elderly home and she hated it there because the people's attitudes suck, they act like they hate their job. If there were better regulation of these facilities it could cut down on abuse and neglect.
I understand your logic, it's not the kids fault, but the woman who is smoking knows this will happen because smokers have higher insurance anyways, just like people who engage in other risky behaviors.
children should get more exercise at school instead of sitting in there desks for most of the day, they only get 15 minutes outside after lunch and then they are confined to there desks. we keep saying that obesity is a problem with the youth its because they don't get to move around for most of the day. its hard to get them to go outside after being trapped inside all day because they then have a tone of homework to do. they should have PE every day and a longer recesses. it has been shone that children who get to run around in the middle of the day perform better on test and all around in school because they have gotten to clear there heads and run out some of the energy they have that was keeping them from focusing
I think that everyone who wants or needs healthcare should have the option, but it shouldn't be forced upon them.
I agree, children are the future population. If our children start off down the wrong road it could possibly change, but then it could get worse. But if they start down the right road with health education, there are no drawbacks.
I think that if more responsibly, such as diagnosis, were given to nurses or even a new created position and were given the proper education it would cut back on long emergency room visits and time for everyone.
If doctors, nurses, and all medical staff should be required to take a day or more break if they are noticeably experiencing burn-out. While a person is "burnt out" they are overwhelmed to the point where it affects their work performance and life. If burn out can be prevented it should.   
Integrating more physical activities into a child's daily life will help form good habits in the future that include working out on a day-to-day basis. I also think that school boards should come up with healthier meals for students and not offer a high-lipid food such as pizza as an alternative to what the main course is.
Healthcare providers should be given, without request, a day or so off to take a break from the work environment. The reason I say they should be given is b/c some HC providers will probably deny to take a day off. Sometimes, that is all a person needs in order to get back on track.
True, but then nurses would have to get paid more for their jobs and maybe there would be no point of having doctors anymore.
Not everyone knows how to take proper care of their child when it is a new experience. Illnesses and other things among them can be prevented and avoided if caregivers of the child were educated and informed on what to do if certain situations were to arise.
Right. But say that healthcare prices were cheaper for a family of 17 than a family of 3, then a lot of people might decide to have more kids;this automatically makes me think of that show that is broadcasted on TLC about the big family.
Well said!
When it comes down to it, the healthcare system is messed up and everyone is just in it for the competition of who gets more money and how.
One of my biggest concerns is the number of people who cannot access healthcare because of an inability to afford insurance. This could be resolved if the healthcare system were subsidized by the government. I believe that the government could do well do channel more funds towards the healthcare system. The funds do not need to be generated via tax hikes; they can be allocated by reducing spending in other aspects such as the military.
I believe that a Universal Healthcare program such as the one in effect in Canada, or other Western European nations such as the UK, Germany, France, or Australia, is the way to the greater good. All of those nations have healthcare, and sterling economies. Treatment for certain conditions like cancer, for example, are difficult to overcome even with large paychecks. The manner in which banks monitor credit means that most people are forced to choose between ignoring treatment, or ruining their credit history, which would make taking out loans, mortgages, financial assistance, extremely difficult. No one in the 21st century, living in the world's most affluent nation, should be denied access to healthcare. Tax rates may increase slightly, but it will be for the overall betterment of society.
I believe that pharmaceuticals should be made available to patients, at minimal costs; provided they have a prescription for it of course. The cost of medicine piles on to already burgeoning hospital bills. The government should look into subsidizing pharmaceutical companies as much as possible to enable them to lower prices for the more expensive pharmaceutical products, which are in high demand i.e. expensive medicines which are sought by a large number of patients because the disease / ailment it is used for is somewhat widespread.
Subsidizing companies can only go so far. Doctor's will be reluctant as this might reduce their earnings. This problem can be circumvented if the government comes up with new laws to assist doctors in other ways. For example, doctors can be made eligible for lower interest rates when taking out mortgages or perhaps their children can be provided with reduced fiscal costs. The idea is that reduced expenses will negate their somewhat reduced earnings which would occur from lowered healthcare bills.
The overall standard of Emergency room services must be raised. It is not uncommon for patients to be waiting for hours before they can be treated. This issue needs to be addressed better.
A good way to improve the healthcare system is   to let specialized computers help doctors diagnose patients. This will save the time and money for the patient as well as receiving better treatment.
Educating the public about most common diseases and explain how they can lower their risk may help reduced the amount of people that will need to be treated for certain diseases.
It is known that soda is the highest contributor to the rise of obesity. We can cut down the consumption of soda in the same way we reduced smoking, by taxing it.  If we are able to reduce the obesity rate we can also lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. If we can reduced that the amount of people needing to be treated will be lowered as well.
I believe that education is the fundamental root of every possible changes in the country. By supporting education, specially in healthcare profession, we can produce more doctors, nurses, and others related healthcare career. The term of supporting education I mean is, for example provide more scholarships for students, provide more opportunity and more campaign to level up the interested of student in Healthcare profession careers. Also, provide more opportunity to international student so they will be able to work in the US, provide more funds and affordable education to low-income student. Tuition needs to be flat rate, rather than keep going up every year. No one would be able to continue their education in a higher level of education if they know they will be broke after graduating.
I agree that emergency room's standard must be raised, and I think more facilities, not just emergency room, also must be built so it is easier and quicker to get to doctor's hand.
the military is an important part of keeping this country strong. yes i agree the government could help more. but i think it should be more on the employers hands on whether the empoyees are covered with well enough health coverage
health care should not be in the governments hands completely. one of my biggest issues with government having to much control of our health care is that the quality will be greatly reduced. when the government is involved, they are cheap and will try and find shortcuts to making such a system without paying much for it.
honestly i think it should be in the hands of the employers. the company a person works for should be the main "manager" so to speak of the health care of their employees. for those who can not work due to disabilities, then a private investor should be held responsible. donations and community service can help to make that a possibility. and more people would rather donate to help those that need it, rather than have it forcibly be taken out of their paychecks. for the homeless, they should get a time limit on how long they are allowed to be insured without a job. if they continue to live on the streets without any attempts of applying and searching for a job, then they should be cut off. free loaders are what is draining from others of this free country.
technology should also be updated. some hospitals are more advanced than others and that is leaving both the patients and the staff at a disadvantage
emergency services in bigger cities are at a disadvantage because anyone can go there with or without insurance. therefore the wait can be substantially longer because a kid without insurance has the flu. that's why i think there should be separate hospitals for people without insurance to go without a real emergency, leaving the ER to do what it was intended to do and allow shorter wait times for the patients with an actual emergency
i think that medicine should be automatically paid for by all insurances if it is for [pain, emergencies, "must-haves to survive"] but others should be paid for depending on the level of insurance you have. kind of like car insurance
preventive care should be increased. programs such as sex-education to minors in schools,  soaps and signs to keep safe, etc should be higher quality and more abundant than they are now. with the increasingly high number of teen pregnancies, flu deaths, etc. it is more important now than ever to make aware of how to prevent such occurances
i think that for doctors and nurses with more than just a BSN that after you have graduated with a bachelor, the college taken following should be paid for by the state. too many smart people do not become doctors or nurse practitioners because the cost of such an education is drowning.
i agree. it will also help decrease the number of misinterpretations and mistakes as well.
i completely agree with you here. foods that are leading causes [and drinks] of obesity should be taxed at a higher rate than foods that are good for you. it is amazing how much more expensive it is to get something that is good for you an it is to get something that is slowly killing the inside of your body. if the government were to intervene in anyway, this should be how.
I watched this film Sicko and it displayed the healthcare in the UK, Germany, and other foreign places.  Everybody had healthcare but I wondered if they had to pay more for taxes.  I believe we should have the right to decide if we want healthcare.  If the governments insists everybody has it then isn't it taking our right to decide.  It would be nice if everybody had healthcare but our economy is already low.  We could make budget cuts to the military but then what happens to our defense system.  Usually when we make budget cuts its money for education.  If the government decides our healthcare then they might decide what we need is too much and take a shortcut that wouldn't benefit us just to save a dollar.
*them
It sounded too good to be true until i seen tax rates may increase slightly.  How big is slightly?  If everybody has healthcare how does it affect healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, etc)?
This is due to the lack of staff and space.  I'm not sure how to solve this problem because the only solution is to hire more people and get bigger spaces which cost money. Any ideas?
It's not that they don't try to educate people about common disease.  That's why we have Google and the media.  It's that people don't care about this topic unless its affecting their life at that specific moment.
i dont think the government should play in any role of the health care. anytime the government takes part in anything with the people the quality greatly decreases. it should be the responsibility of the workplace.
exactly and the last thing we need is for money to be taken from our education. its because people arent getting a good enough education that they are needing medicare. if more people focused and highering their education, and if the government went more into helping the education system less people would need government care to afford health care. less people would get sick because they would be able to afford a cleaner enviroment
educate better, dont make college so expensive so more people can go and get such a good education and pursue things like doctors, nurses, surgeons.
i am a big believer in the laissez-fare** approach to government. "handsoff approach" whenever the government is involved, the quality is decreased, the care is decreased, and honestly so many shortcuts are taken, that people might as well not even use it. whenever private companies do anything, the quality is a lot higher because they need you to want it, and to buy it, so they are going to make it to the best of their ability. yes it might be a little more pricey, but wouldn't it be worth it if the product was better? this is how i feel towards government controlling our health care systems, honestly the quality would suck if it were under the government hands. the only thing i think the government should help with is education. Sweden, if you are a born citizen, you get to go to college for free. this is how it should be here in America. with a smarter population, health care would take care of itself. people would be able to afford their own health care. also we might become a top country once again. i still think their needs to be competition into what college a person attends though, otherwise college would be like high school, just a right of passage.
I agreed that education on preventive care need to be raised. In addition, there should be ways to make this information available to everyone, and making everyone aware of it. Nowadays, we know that not many people are interested and unaware of what can they do to prevent themselves from disease but if we could make the preventive care campaign more interesting and easier to understand, it would eventually got into everyone's head.
I think it's people's right whether they want or do not want to have health insurance. Indeed, it is great if everyone has health insurance, but if it's not their will then there shouldn't be any unfair force to get one. Some people knows how to take care and prevent them from disease, such as eating right. This will help cutting government's budget that wanted to provide health insurance to everyone. With this money, government can use it to build more Emergency care, and that's where everyone really need because we don't know what's going to happen to us at any moment.
Totally agree on education system. The easier to get access to education, the more people will wanted to get education. The competition of career in market will increase, people would seek even higher education to compete, consequently, more people are aware and educated, we can produce not just a better healthcare system, but others too such as economic.
Investing in emerging healthcare companies will increase competition and hopefully lower the price of medication and equipment.
Reforming the patten to lower the amount of time a pharmaceutical company can hold the right to monopolies their product will help a lot
I like this idea. I do believe that if the government are in control of our government then they'll take many short cuts to just save a buck. 
It would be nice for everybody to have health insurance but I know many people who rarely go to the doctors.  Should they have to pay so much just for healthcare when they only visit for check ups? 
I believe that the healthcare plan is to help the low income and it takes away from people who can afford healthcare because they went to college and got well paying jobs.  Many low income people didnt go to college because of the money for college tuition so if we had money for them to go to college then maybe more people would have healthcare.
Government should restricted their inspection on the Food and Drink company to make sure the quality of the food and drink won't cause harm for the body. Also, government should support and help lowered price on "Healthy" menu, and "Organic" products, so more people can afford the good products. This will not only prevent people from getting sick and become obese, but raise the economic on the farmers side.
Vaccines supply should have enough when its needed. For example, the meningitis vaccine last year, though people without insurance can get it for $25 but what happened was the vaccines weren't enough for everyone, and they have to get them from the private care for over $100. Government should be more prepared on their stocks.
The importance of the military should not be undermined. However, we in the US are as further away from doing that than any nation in the world. The United States spends more on military than any nation in the world. A lot of that spending is superfluous and there is plenty of room to make budget cuts there.
I also believe in minimal government intervention within the economy; however some intervention is still necessary to a certain extent. Millions of people are priced out of healthcare today meaning that often this system is causing more harm than good. This is when the government needs to step in and make certain restrictions. Private companies work better than state run ones, however their primary motive is profit. When it comes to healthcare, we have to remember that this method will inevitably price out some customers ('patients'). It is essential that nobody gets left behind. Just like education, healthcare is a need which should not be denied to any citizen.
I think that the whole structure regarding insurance needs to be revamped. However, to ensure that everybody has access to healthcare is costly and therefore requires funds, hence making sure that everybody has insurance. These funds can also be raised via taxes, or subsidizing doctors.
Certain industries should compensate their workers with full healthcare benefits. It is more likely for someone working around nuclear reactors, for instance, to contract cancer from the radiation. These companies should be fully liable for their workers' healthcare costs.
exactly. like maybe make a free information clinic for preventions awareness
i agree. it doesnt help when the things that are healthy for the body costs more than the things that are bad.
i agree. the more dangerous or health-risk the job is, the more the company should help with health care.
when it comes to pharmaceuticals, i think that should coincide with my previous idea that it should be taken away from the governments hand and into the hands of the companies people are employed for. along with getting health care, this should also cover medicines needed to be able to return to work healthy. employers don't want to have employees being out sick all the time, so this in itself will be incentive to having a good health care company set up for their employees. 
private companies will have the incentive of wanting their employees in their best health state, so this would make them choose a proper and effective health care plan without killing their pockets. also the fact that it is the companies job to provide for health care and not the government will help force the people who are riding on government money and peoples taxes for health and food to go out and actually look for a real job. so this in itself will decrease unemployment. lastly i agree government will have to help a little for the people who just are having bad luck with a job, but this should be a minimal hand, and for a minimal time period. at most maybe 6 months, that way people don't take advantage of our government, and make it fair for the people that work hard for their money and have to give out big taxes because other people don't have jobs. so total this would 1. increase quality. 2. decrease unemployment 3. decrease taxes. this is america, land of opportunity, not land of free-loaders.
There should be a predetermined weight measurement for males and females (considering heights, bone mass, family history) and if they were to be beyond it, they should pay a tax so that the incentive to remaining overweight/obese is removed.
Emergency room services could be faster with more nurses and doctors tending to more patients thus reducing the amount of waiting room buildup.
Health in an individual should determine their health insurance payments. The healthier one is, the less they pay. This would create an incentive to remain healthy.
Free/reduced screenings for things (breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.) should be more greatly communicated so that a majority of the surrounding population would be aware of it and take advantage of the opportunity.
Pharmaceutical companies could be taxed each time they release a new medication so that over-prescribing antibiotics and forcing people to pay an immense amount of money for medicine could be reduced.
When determining eligibility for government health insurance, other factors should be considered instead of just income and amount of children.
Or the amount that could be saved could be placed into a private retirement account.
Students should be required to take more credits of physical education and health to be better educated about their bodies.
Children should have more recess time.
More specifically, they should be taught about current nutrition guidelines in their PE courses to address the obesity epidemic. Nutrition courses should be provided at 7th grade and again in secondary school (9-12).
Health care professionals should be on a rating system nationwide to ensure professionalism when dealing with patients. This could be online, like a "ratemyprofessor" type system which rates on several aspects of the professional. This way patients can look up their doctors online before choosing them, and automatically the standard for quality care will increase because of demand.
have automated / self-service screenings, scannings like MRIs, X-Rays, and such guided by a computer to reduce cost of labor (except for the actual examination of the results which are provided by the doc)
tax the wealthy (350k annual income) at a 5% increase to reduce costs of simple procedures only
Low-income families (parent and child) should be granted cheaper health care service or insurance. Either flat-rate reduction from the hospital or reduced insurance prices from the insurance companies. This discount can be limited (say, one annual visit) to avoid abuse.
provide extensive, long-term payment plans that are more flexible with interest equal to inflation.
Also free/reduced screenings for students of all ages from the elementary to the university level should be given 1 free annual check-up and reduced screenings after the first initial screening.
Also, similar to a "ratemyprofessor" website/system, there could be a national website similar to "webmd.com" in which one can check their symptoms and assess whether a doctor's visit is necessary to cut down on costs. The information being provided for the website will be accurate so as to narrow down other information that could conflict when searching for medical symptoms on the internet.
Low-income should pay a certain amount per doctor's visit, mid-income increased from there, and high-income charged the most with income being the only factor in determining health insurance coverage and costs. (For example: cost per visit could be $15, $35, and $55 or something along those lines.)
Emergency room services should have the largest staff (more doctors) to properly assess each individual before turning them away.
There should be more small clinics built locally to reduce the build up in hospitals and larger doctors offices.
Enrolled students should have opportunities to receive free health care benefits, it would bring in more students, better grades, and higher education. So of course the probable way to do this would be to require students to maintain a certain GPA to ensure responsibility. Also have better health care depending on how high the GPA is.
It would be good if healthcare gave people a goal as well, such as reward people for being healthy, like along the lines of a certain health insurance company (I can't think of the name) that gives you a device to monitor how many steps you take and you get a small reward for so many steps achieved in a day/week. And this can be as small as a discount to doctor visits or how much you pay for health insurance
Make health care cheaper or perhaps more available for the fully employed. And make it possible to have some sort of health care for all jobs who hire full time.
People who are retired should get free healthcare when they are not able to afford it
There needs to be certain "rules" when applying for free/reduced healthcare. It shouldn't be for anyone.
Nurses shouldn't determine how good they take care of their patients by their patients' insurance.
Also, when someone fills out the paperwork the first time they are taken to the ER, it should be kept on file so they don't have to fill out the same paperwork the next time they are there unless there needs to be some changes to the files. This will decrease the waiting time.
Every hospital should be required to have the most updated machinery. This will prevent faulty tests.
Also, they should receive annual check ups for either free or reduced pay.
Doctors need to assess their patients more carefully to prevent people from being prescribed medications that they abuse or don't need.
They should require someone to take a drug test (testing for illegal drugs) to determine whether or not someone is able to receive free/reduced healthcare. Because if they are doing drugs then they don't have good health and obviously don't care if they have good health.
Pharmaceutical companies should pay a tax each time they output new medicine to reduce the over prescribing of medicine and high medicine cost.
Or the patient could keep a copy of their files and bring it each time they need to visit the ER. This could help keep everything organized since so many people go through the ER each day and keeping all the paperwork on file could be difficult.
Having more doctors available could help this so that they have the time to really assess a patient instead of running around trying to get to everybody.
This could be done by keeping the patient's insurance information confidential from the nurse by having another person designated for any insurance information/claims.
The teachers required to teach should be certified in teaching nutrition (i.e. degree in nutrition/fitness/ etc.) instead of coaches who teach the course just to coach a sport.
Something should be done to reduce those who take advantage of any benefits they receive. There should be a screening process to determine where their income goes to see if one is truly eligible for health insurance benefits.
And they should have certain regulations for the people who don't work full time and need insurance.
Agreed. A free drug test. If that drug test is failed, then they would have to wait an entire year to be able to apply for annual healthcare again. If the drug test is passed, then the first screening should be free.
They could also take a little away from their insurance for every couple of pounds they are over weight.
Or they could get bonus checks that contain all of the money they saved by being healthy to show that staying healthy pays off.
And if they aren't spending their money right, their benefits should be minimized or taken away until they can learn how to spend their money.
Maybe the minimum GPA is a 2.5 and it would be the most basic healthcare or for a minimum cost of, say, $10. Then, GPA's higher than a 3.0 receive a free screening, reduced costs on tests, medication, etc.
They should also somehow broadcast the symptoms of some of the common cancers so that people can identify their symptoms and go to the doctor sooner. They could do this with commercials, magazines, newspapers, radio, etc.
Maybe an assessment for mental instability to ensure that there isn't a possibility of becoming addicted to a certain drug due to certain tendencies.
They should be required to take a drug test.
They should at least get free or reduced annual check ups.
Healthcare could be cheaper for full-time employees, and it could also be offered to part-time employees for a different cost per visit or as necessary. A lot of part-time jobs don't offer a healthcare provider for their part-time employees; A lot of part-time employees are students at a university who need healthcare benefits also.
That would be good, or to at least put the individual on probation or have an increase percentage of monthly pay for health insurance
Also a credit check on an individual could possibly award an individual cheaper health care or factors such as a good driving record
I agree with the fact that children should be given more times for physical activities, so an extra health class along with P.E and recess should help
Funds should be given to schools to have healthier cafeteria food as well
Perhaps instead of a negative tax (money being taken away), we can provide some sort of positive reinforcement to provide incentive to remain healthy and smart. Incentives include discounts, coupons, refunds, returns. Things like that because we know we can't just give away money.
Students in high school when taking their fitness tests could be challenged to increase their performance (and thus their fitness) as time goes on, and be provided incentives to do so. Simple things like a free party, or better yet, a day outside could be an award.
In order to combat diabetes and heart disease, both of which are deadly conditions in America, we could make the fitness community more popular. Youtube and television programs are already gaining popularity with Dr. Oz and amateur youtube stars. If awareness is spread of fitness, more people would be less likely to fall ill to complications like heart disease and diabetes. Appeals to many different types of audiences would need to be tried. For kids, maybe, the focus should be how physical activity can be fun and friendly. For adults, say we focus on the logical health benefits to being fit. And young adults perhaps the aesthetic appeal to being healthy. put the adverts where sedentary people would see them (in video games, at the store, tv, whatever).
They should do a drug test or background check on everyone before prescribing them medicine. They need to come up with a shot that can be used instead of pain medicine for all of the people that failed. That way the doctors can still give them pain medicine but it cannot be abused.
They could also be rewarded with homework passes or test bonus points.
The school/teachers could do fundraisers to help with this cost also.
They should be required to run one mile every week. On the other days, they could play fun games to keep them from getting burned out and not liking PE anymore.
Agreed. Some factors like good driving record, good background check, and a healthy weight could be awarded with cheaper/reduced health care.
It should be required every year during junior high and high school instead of just one credit for 3-4 years.
This will give them more time to "play" and work off the food they just ate.
I agree and also events for school wide marathon competition or fitness courses with a variety of awards. Fitness is just as important as education and things like this should be enforced
It would be good include more physical activity choices for schools as well, such as different sports, swim team, wrestling, martial arts and others in more school to encourage better fitness and make it fun
Maybe even offer free workout programs on YouTube. (Things that resemble Insanity or P90x but doesn't cost anything.)
Health insurance could have requirements to have an annual check up with doctors to evaluate health by physical tests. If the individual can achieve a certain standard that aligns with a healthy balance and lifestyle, cost could be discounted for a certain amount of time until the following check up. If failed, no discount until one returns and proves otherwise
School districts need to learn how to budget. In most cases, other programs get greater funding. Like in some schools, more money might go towards the football department instead of the math department. They need to figure out what is more beneficial for the majority of students and budget around that.
There should also be some activities that aren't sport based. Not all students have the time to dedicate themselves to too many things so maybe something like a P.E. class with a certain emphasis can be created. For example, a swimming class but necessarily doing things as part of a team like a water aerobics class.
Healthier foods should be enforced in restaurants, especially fast food. Even though most establish a low calorie menu, it still is not necessarily good to eat. So I think there should be a bigger push in that direction to help health
Agreed. There should be more than one healthy option at each fast food restaurant. Or maybe, there should be a fast food chain dedicated directly to healthier option like Snappy Salads.
Agreed. A lot of students would much rather eat a bag of chips and a coke for lunch than eat the cafeteria food being served to the rest of the student body because the food is not remotely healthy. Healthier options should be given instead of cheesy, greasy foods.
All school levels should require PE for every year of school from elementary until high school. Those playing sports could take another class separate from the rest of the students to practice on that sport and not intimidate those who are not equally as well.
Health care should be available to everyone.
in addition that health care should be available to everyone , a small fee should be charged for applying for receiving health care that everybody can afford.
health care should be free for the needy families, those whom have low income and have large family. 
All health care providers and agencies should accept health care insurance and medicate insurance.
Health care should be more funded by the government ; the government should purpose a large budget for health care. 
Health care agencies on a university campus should provide free basic healthcare to students that show the need for it, as the healthcare was a part of the tuition for the university.
The government should support health care technology and set a budget for it , especially in the research fields for finding new cure and medicine for several diseases. 
The government should build more health agencies in many different areas around the USA that will provide all sorts of different health services ranging from check-ups to surgeries.   
Health care should be limited for those who misuses it. An example, buying drugs or medicine and use them in an illegal matter in a way to experience pleasure (getting high).
In a case of an emergency , such as someone who got shot , the patients should be admitted in the emergency room even if they don't have or carry health insurance. The cost of the surgeries and medical expenses should be determined according to the person's income , and an aid program should be available if the patient is needy or have low income.
Medicine should be available to everyone.
A healthcare plan? Some people don't want to see their tax money going to provide a free healthcare plan though for people who might not even really need / "deserve" it.
And also for better, more precise surgical technologies.
I think first before we can try to fix the healthcare system people need to be informed of how it works and stuff. Because I believe maybe some people aren't sure of how the healthcare system in America works especially dealing with insurance and all that.
People should be educated about how to react in emergency situations. For example, if someone broke a bone or if anyone is having a seizure, stroke, heart attack, etc., it would be ideal if the general public knew how to react in those types of situations and at least hold it off until help arrives.
There should be more clinics around cities. It's more convenient than having to go to the doctor / a hospital if it's just a minor problem.
For long-term patients, there should be a person they can talk to so if their families can't really come and visit all the time, they will still have someone to be there for / with them.
A budget should be set aside for people / families that really do need free / reduced healthcare fees, though. There should be certain criteria, however, to determine who gets what. Maybe background / history checks on the person. This way, people can receive the same level of healthcare, plus people may feel this is more justified (about spending their tax money) because of the background checks.
  healthcare should be available to everyone, but to varying degrees. it's a fundamental right to live, but people should get what is appropriate. perhaps helathcare should be based on current health, job environment, place of residence, etc.
not everyone, in the eyes of many, deserve free healthcare. it should cost, but to varying levels. I believe the people who work in dangerous fields that endanger their lives should have access to better healthcare than say to the people who are unemployed for long periods of time. in theory, the oil field worker is at greater risk than the stay at home mom.
abortion shouldn't be covered by healthcare. they have birth control for that.
low income families should have healthcare, but at a cost. perhaps there should be a calculator to calculate income/healthcare cost. nothing in the world is free, and it is irresponsible to give people the illusion that healthcare is a free service.
healthcare is a more of a service then a right. if we think about it strictly as a right, then it might as well be free. if healthcare is free, for anyone, we might as well dig ourselves a hole. there will be a deficit that will be very hard to get out of.
healthcare need not be expensive, but a bare a minimum, and should be on a " you get what you pay for" format.
to increase knowledge of how to self diagnose symptoms, or to prevent sickness, upon leaving a medical office, after a check up, operation, whatever, large books of common sicknesses, their symptoms, and prevention, should be available. just like how telephone companies used to give phone books for free, or included in the payment. if people were more readily informed by a trust worthy source (because you can't always trust the internet), many problems could be avoided. not everyone has access to the internet, but almost everyone can read nowadays. unless this has already been implemented...then nvm
school nurses need to be more educated on the more serious sides of health issues. too often have i heard, and have been told myself "I'm not sure, ask your doctor."
the prices of delivering a baby should be lessened. it's sad that it costs a fortune to be born, a fortune to live, and a fortune to die. since the population will no doubt increase, and HAS been increasing, the price should be lopwered, sine  babies are being born everywhere, everyday, all day.
personal religious beliefs aside, parents who are considering birthing a child who is guaranteed a life of suffering need to be REALLY informed of the testimony of people who have the same disease that are alive. I was against abortion 100% until I heard a disease stricken man say " mother, why didn't you abort me? you should have. I would have aborted myself."
abortions need to have a rising price tag per operation. 1 abortion is bad enough, any more is a sign of lack of responsibility and stupidity, and they should be fined for it.
In some high schools it is required to take health and I think during that course they should learn about the health care system in place at the time and the reason people need it. if not in health class maybe governmentf
health care should provide people to go to say family doctors or neighborhood doctors for the common cold or injury and leave the ER for the emergencies. Thus the ERs will be less crowded so the people who really need help can get it much much soonere
The cost of medicine should be reduced to the very very bare minimum for those who need it to stay aalive
A bigger budget should be given to the biomedical labs to cure cancerr
There should be a continue growth of health care providers so the "competition" aspect of it would lower the cost of health care.
preventive care should increase in order to decrease the doctor visits in the future. say new borns and even during the pregancy state. the mother should be given everything needed to have a healthy baby.
I think we should make getting a doctor degree more affordable so well have more doctors and maybe even enough to have a doctor and a nurse in schools so the poor children in school can have a free doctors visit during school.
There have been instances where a family is not being helped because they have no insurance and the hospital is unsure if the family can pay the money. Health care should be provided in order to decrease the amount of deaths in America. Hospitals should help those in need if they are willing to sign a contract saying they will pay in time.
This is very true. Many people in poor families do not go to the doctor unless they are very ill and may not be able to pay the full amount for health care. These costs should be reduced so that the death rate decreases in America.
In other countries, health care does not cost as much and citizens are able to go to the doctor whenever they need it. I have heard of instances when people from other countries go to the doctor just to treat a minor cold. America's health care system needs to have a lower price on service and medicine at hospitals.
Public and private schools should teach more in the health classes than they do now. This way students would know how to react in emergency situations and less deaths may occur.
I completely agree. Prices of health care does not vary so a person that makes an average of $300,000 annually pays the same amount for health care as someone who earns $30,000. Without insurance, no help is provided. Not many people from unwealthy families can pay for the necessary help.
Health care should be provided to everyone but insurance should be optional and not taken out of each paycheck. In many instances, when people try to use the Insurance that was taken out of their paychecks, the hospitals tell them that the insurance is unavailable and they would have to pay the full amount upfront or no care is provided.
This is true. If healthcare was free, doctors and nurses may get paid less and therefore, America would have an even higher demand for nurses and doctors. Many doctors may quit because the income may be cut.
Hospitals seem to be discriminative when it comes to who to help first. Since America consists of many Hispanics, more Hispanic nurses and doctors should be hired.
part of the incentive to becoming a doctor is the high pay. the whole flow of income needs to be rethought so that we can still pay our doctors their fair share, while being able to give everyone who needs healthcare their share as well.
an in depth evaluation of a specialist, or perhaps a program,  maybe over the phone or through a computer service, to help determine whether it'd be best to go to the ER versus the family doctor.
if there ARE cures to cancer, and it is being withheld due to the fact that the economy needs people to die to sustain itself, then there needs to be much better treatment.
there needs to be a higher price on people who partake in routine destructive recreational activities such as smoking, drinking, etc. of course, the price would only be raised if the uses had been over a certain limit. say, a person is allowed 3 cigarettes a week. you can smoke more, but the cost of, I don't know, a monthly insurance bill will raise. America seems to be one of the few countries that is willing to kill its citizens just to make a buck. this needs to change. this would raise the incentive to be healthier.
It is 2013, and we're still being told in the Diagnosis Centers, "we don't know what is wrong". More money needs to be allotted to health research, because there are more than a few industries that could use a cut.
America needs to model it's healthcare after the Swiss. End of story. Take the precautions, take the time, but do it.
I think it should be covered by the health care. If anti pregnancy pills didn't work , which happened in many cases , health care should be available for such situation. 
I agree with that , but I would better if it wasn't limited for cancer only but other diseases such HIV , AIDS , etc...
I agree! that can lead to extra examines and procedures that can be costly and unnecessary, raising the medical bill expenses.
The government should provide budget for research such as : advanced surgical tools, robotic controlled surgeries, and new surgical procedures.
who pays for the patients in the mental institutions? themselves? Us or is the government paying to keep them secure?
Along with all the mental disorders as well.
The patients whom are in commas on life support, can not pay for there care, but its up to there love ones and when they cant pay, what happens to them. the doctors have little clue when or if they will ever wake up. and a lot of times some give up hope and pull the plug.
I think that until it is absolute certain that a patient in a comma on life support is comptely loss than healthcare should cover them
cancer treatment should definitely not be withheld and given only to those who can afford the extremely rediculous amount of money it costs to be treated.
This is very true. Most families can't afford to have the patient laying in a bed for the possibility that their loved one may live, so they just tell the doctors to pull the plug. It should not cost so much for a person to lay in a bed.. only the treatment should be charged
A visitation to the emergency room costs so much even if there is nothing really wrong with you. I went to the emergency room because i got stung by a wasp and i am deathly allergic. The doctors told me that taking benedryl right after i get stung will make my swelling go down. We paid over $100 for a doctor to tell me to take a medication that most people have in their homes already.
It should not cost so much for an ambulance to come to an emergency. Many people call the fire department instead of the ambulance because they both take you to the hospital but one is free and the other costs hundreds of dollars.
If health care is going to cost so much, at least do something about the pollution in the air.. Since there is so much pollution, people have a hard time breathing and therefore get things like asthma and have to buy an inhaler.
your health is in danger as you age. So health treatment should be cheaper for older people. Especially because most of them are retired and do not have  source for money besides their retirement money.
Nursing home costs should be lower and the treatment should be better. Older people need to be treated gently and with care. i have visited a nursing home where the patient is not talked to and just left to lay in a bed the whole day. This should be changed.
if the hospital bill is going to continue to be high, check ups should be free and the pharmaceuticals should be much cheaper.
there should be a personality requirement for doctors and nurses. Difficult to upset, easy to calm. Optimistic and very caring. Willing to help others without being watched. Things of that nature. Nurses and doctors seem to be getting more and more cruel every year.
It's just hard sometimes and gets overwhelming, but I agree because part of being in the healthcare / medical field isn't just to get money but also to help others, and caring is a part of that.
I went to a free clinic to volunteer, and these people whose children had diabetes, a cold, etc. didn't even have any medicine at all to at least alleviate some symptoms.
It's so easy for people to say that we should have free healthcare or something along those lines, but it's unfair to the doctors/nurses/etc. to just provide free service especially if they get paid less because of all of the money and time and effort they've spent getting to that point.
Mental health and mental health facilities should be more looked into. I doubt many people know how treatment is at those facilities. It is often overlooked in the healthcare field because when people hear the word "healthcare" they just think of your typical hospitals with the ER and whatnot.
more money and research and development should go into the technology to have it so advance that it can help significantly in the detection and treatment of cancer and any other illness or injury.
agreed and also most of the elderly that I know of have no intention of going to a old folks home, and so the cheaper the medicine is for them to stay healthy, the longer they can live happy and independent.
It is unneccery to go to the ER when all you have is a common cold. Yet only a few clinics in towns stay open past 5 and only on week days. and if it cant wait till morning or the weekend but its not serious like broken bones, the ER should not be that expensive
the ER is just a tad too expensive. The cost is supposed to make the common cold and cuts go to a clinic and leave the ER to the emergency. But its also too expensive to make someone who might have serious problem stay at home and wait to sees if it goes away.
a very good point. But in the same time , everyone should have the right of living ; the people in commas should be treated as any other hospitalized patient. Health care should provide the medical expenses for that patient and ask the family if they contribute for the paying , if not , then the costs are waived. I am not sure for how long is the period where we give up on people in commas.
ER should be limited to people with a serious life threatening condition or a serious injury. A lot of people now days are in long lines for the ER room due to the lack of identifying what is serious and what is not.
Yes I agree with this. Our ERs are too expensive even though you don't show a serious injury , or you need a minimum help. The cost must be reduced, and help should be provided right away.
I agree. Older people should be qualified to pay a range of nothing to about 2% of the medical expenses.
The Ambulances should be free and covered by the government same as police departments and fire departments. 
Yes that is a very important point. Nurses/doctors and the medical staff must be friendly , passionate , and caring because we need to make patients feel comfortable and reduce their pain and anxiety. 
Patients are normally frightened by hospitals because of anxiety or past experiences. Since this is the normal behavior of patients, our nurses and doctors should be very warm and easy to talk to. Nurses and doctors should also be able to communicate with patients in a way that the patients can understand.
Health is a big issue all over the world. Since this is such a big topic, the government should look into it more often than they do now. Health care should also be paid mostly by the government if the disease or illness is serious so that people are able to live longer.
i dont see why america sees it as a threat for people to live longer... cancer and asthma have become increasingly common when the government stated this and therefore, more people die at younger ages. is the government doing something to shorten our life span? this should definitely stop immediately. People should be able to live life without breathing in random things that planes spray into the air.
medical insurance should help regular people almost as much as they help nurses and doctors. insurance should not have random expiration dates unless you decide personally to stop paying for the insurance.
many doctors are pushed to tell patients that they need some kind of medication when it is not really necessary. later on, the patient calls the doctor and tells them that the pills did not have any affect and that they feel the same as before they took the medication. The doctor will then prescribe another medication and tell the patient that this would be more effective. This takes money out of the patient's pockets and puts more money into the government's. These behaviors should not continue.
there should be certain medication that is on shelves at stores. Some people do not have money to go visit a doctor and may already know what is wrong with them. These people would most likely just want to go to the pharmacy and receive the medication instead of  having to pay an extra hospital bill.
More than one pharmacist should be on duty at each pharmacy. Since the pharmacist is the only person that can do main tasks, the process to make the medication is slow if only one pharmacist is working. This causes a delay and customers are not able to receive their medication quickly and therefore become upset.
There should be more free dietician programs online or on tv in america because the health of america is at risk when it comes to dieting habits. These dieticians should be paid by the government instead of by each patient. The wage should be approximately the same.
Computers should be modified to where they do not harm your eyes as much as they do now. Same with televisions and cell phones. These items are known to damage your eyes and the average age to begin wearing glasses is much lower than it used to be.
Health care for pregnancies should also be cheaper since pregnant women tend to visit the hospital more than average.
The people who work the telephones at doctors' offices need to be more educated on common symptoms and be able to diagnose things WITHOUT the need the need to go 100 bucks to be told, "go take benadryl". Yes, this would perhaps lead to a little less money being made by the doctor, but would in turn lead to more patient faith and trust. When patients know that the doctor wants to make his cut WHILE trying to save his patients as much money as possible, it leads to customer loyalty.
I don't want to be THAT guy, but if marijuana were legalized for medicinal use, perhaps the following *could* happen: 1) Doctor's would be making a lot more money 2) It's a much cheaper than a bottle of pills for quite a few disorders 3) The illegitimate drug trade in America would collapse, *hopefully* leading to a lower crime rate 4) Would people do it to get high, just because? Of course, why the heck do people use Vicodin or Purple drank? 5)Nothing in the world would really change, because illegality of marijuana hasn't done a darn thing to stop it. Then again, money is money. Illegal or not, drugs bring in ALOT of money. Somewhere down the line, that money gets put back into Uncle Sam's pocket. Maybe the gv't doesn't want to legalize fully for just that reason.
What if hospitals were like an assembly line. Because assembly lines are efficient and cheap. Like everyone would do one job at people would just go down a conveyor belt.
Or maybe everyone should have a given free set of emergency pills / medicine for their home or whatever.
Yeah because sometimes they'll prescribe you medicine that you can get OTC but they'll make you pay more for the prescribed medicine
People should be more educated about what kind of doctors/specialist they need to see because for example, someone's doctor (general practitioner) kept prescribing her different BRANDS of an SSRI antidepressant, none of which worked, while what she actually needed was to see a psychiatrist who was able to prescribe her a different TYPE of antidepressants like an MAO inhibitor.
Children should also be taught not to shove their faces on computer / TV / game consoles / phone screens etc. so they don't ruin their eyes at a young age.
What if there was kind of like an OnStar for medical things. Not like webMD but actual doctors or nurses or something for emergencies. Then you could do it from your phone and whatnot
Maybe banks should automatically put a small set amount of everyone's money into a separate savings account for that person that's specifically for healthcare. It doesn't have to be much. And then when they need something they just pay with what they have in that account and the government covers the rest of it.
That way people pay according to their income. Like 2% let's say gets put into this account monthly
People should be taught better on proper nutrition. We KNOW obesity is an issue, we KNOW not to eat greasy, oily, sugary foods, but I don't think some people understand how badly this really affects your body not just in terms of making you "fat" but also how it affects your organs, heart, mind, etc.
The technology have been improving drastically
The Health Care system first choice should not be pharmaceuticals unless the remedies and holistic way does not fully work on patients.
I think the health education is great. The years and experience needed to be in Health Care helps make the overall health care great for the people that are in need.
The emergency room services can always improve. Although first come first serve comes to play, I believe it depends on the severity of the patient.
Some people cannot afford health insurance. Although there is medicaid, the government becomes more in debt. But I think that everyone should have health insurance. Health is important and some people may need it when they are in need or of an emergency. So i think there should be a law to have health insurance.
Mental health of an individual can vary. We all can get sick, or have an emergency. Health insurance is important. Although it can be costly, we should find a way so that the Americans of the United States have insurance for their needs.
Technology from back then to now have improved so much. I think that the technology aspect of the Health Care is great.
Patients always comes first. Cannot stress that enough.
I think that most Americans should have the same level of insurance care. Although health insurance prices differs, some americans are just more fortunate than others.
Health care is a topic that not most Americans really take the time to think about. Health care is what keeps us going when our body is shutting down.
The healthcare should pay more attention to how the patients are being treated. Some nurses/doctors and etcs can sometimes treat their patients horribly. Although it is a tough job, the health care workers are there for a reason and chose to be there. But some does not care for the patient entirely.
Patient's should always be taken care of 100 percent with care and patience.
Pharmaceuticals should be carefully given to patients.
Everything can always use a little improving including our Health Care.
Doctors, indeed have higher educational levels, but nurses are significantly important just the same amount.
pharmaceuticals are pricey
emergency room services are hectic, and so it should be more organized when patients are running in.
Preventative care is so important because if you start taking care of your body at a younger age you wont have so many complication when it comes to your health.By teaching people alternative ways about preventative care like eating right and exercising
 Exercise is very important and should be a requirement for better living in regards to your health.
i believe that everyone should receive equal healthcare insurance but in order to get there we have to make certain sacrifices but i don't know where to start.    
Mental health is a hard topic because the people in the facility need the special care but i believe that the patients don't need all of the drugs that are administered to them. In a sense less is more.  
Pharmaceutical Company's make a lot of money even when they shouldn't because the drugs that are given to the patients aren't working . The medicine is either too strong and making them sick or nothing is improving, but in order to change the pharmaceutical drugs needs to alternate to a more natural substance and to test out the product more on different groups of people to ensure the quality of the drug.   
Emergency rooms can do better in a sense because they are always in a rush and some doctors don't take the time to listen to the patients needs or complaints.In order to fix the problem they should slow down and actually take the time to listen to the patient after all the patients are the ones that are paying the doctors so they should be more than willing to listen.
Healthcare insurance needs a whole makeover.
 Health Care Education is good. As times go by people are starting to realize the importance of health and are willing to listen and open-minded to new ideas.
In regards to sex education kids are starting to talk about "sex" at a younger age and dont have the right information given to them. In order to prevent this from happening you should start a younger age than healthcare providers may be comfortable with and  provide the appropriate information but dont give so much away all at once and allow them to ask questions if need be.
Emergency Room services are in need of help. I believe that yes if you come in before 20 other people then yes, you should be treated before the other patients. However, when it comes to people in need of medical attention because of how bad their issue is then by all means take them before someone who is just getting a checkup.
I believe everyone deserves healthcare, but the current healthcare system proposed is wrong.
As of the mental health patients i believe that sometimes the healthcare providers might issue drugs just so the patient can try or might not need.
Emergency rooms should be organized better. There should be a system that all medical healthcare providers follow.
I think the amount of money that Americans pay for pharmaceuticals is to much.
The technology in todays current era has increased allowing for new discoveries and cures to be found. All healthcare facilities should be updated.
If a patient goes in for help they should be given the best care and attention they need.
As americans we should be taking care of our bodies and not allowing ourselves to be put in the situation where we would have to go to a healthcare facility, but stuff happens that we cant stop.
Eating right, working out, and having a stable mental health are key factors that lead to a healthy lifestyle.
For preventive healthcare it is the subjects job to go in for checkups so there are no underlying or hidden problems that might turn out to be a bigger problem down the road.
I think all americans should know what our current healthcare is all about.
Healthcare providers should take the time to fully understand what is wrong with the patient and not just blow it off or just assume something else.
Not everybody is going to fully support the healthcare system. Not everyone is going to be happy, but the healthcare system should be redone to satisfy the needs of the american people
Maybe america should look at other established countries and see if it working for those countries.
The healthcare system can always be improved
if someone is need they should be cared for with or without insurance
the health care system needs an immense amount of improvement
it shouldnt be required if people cant afford it because then it takes away from the hardworkers
americans should invest more in their health Yes american people yes, but for those who are not here legaly, they should not
health insurance is important to have because unexpected things occur everyday
the process of the emergency room could be improved greatly
it takes hours for a real emergency to be treated due to the overflow of patients
the emergency room should be strictly for emergencys to fix that problem
alot of doctors are overwhelmed and in a rush to get to the next patient
nurses are needed and important
the finance required to go to the emergency room or a hospital are extremely pricey and most of the time unaffordable which is where health insurance becomes useful
it is rare that one is provided with education about health care
Health and Health Care should be provided by the individual themselves. The least amount of harm that individuals put into there body should be a decided  factor of what an individual deserves a type of health care. Most of the time in an Emergency Room,It takes minutes and sometimes even hours to see a doctor. And when you do they have you in a room for almost 45 minutes and then they decide to come take vital signs or do a health check and then charge more than what the doctor saw you.
I would like to see cross state lines health insurance.
Circle of Life. We cannot stop evolution. Death should be just as important as Life.
I think Nurses should be doing more than just just taking mediocre test that can be learned online.
Competetion between insurance companies does have an affect of prices coming down.
In order to have to same level of insurance care then the same individuals need to have the same type of illness.
School control lunches hurt healthy kids.
I think a specific amount of money should be dictated a year to each individual to buy health insurance.
Public school should be considered unhealthy.
Get rid of welfare programs. laziness can cause obesity.
everyone must join a armed force department.
No genetically grown food.
Given those that dont belong here legally health care drives up the cost of health care for average americans.
Secure our borders
Those with preexisting conditions should not be excluded in any health care premiums if they are they should be covered by the government. Only if if was preexisting.
Need to be raised by both parents..
if there is a law to have health insurance then the people who cannot afford insurance will be unable to pay the fine for not having insurance which will cause more financial problems for that person
For those that needs emergency treatment and does not have insurance, they should still be treated as if they do have insurance which goes towards the first come first served but i believe that those who dont have insurance go to the emergency room, remember that they do not have insurance, but still go anyways because they think can be quickly treated because they are in need of medical attention knowing that itll be months before they can pay off the medical bill
Health care should be cheaper for those that are already on medicare and other health care programs
People who apply for health care should be approved no matter what even if they are unable to pay the fees on time because everywhere you go, insurance is always needed
pharmaceutials should make their products cheaper for those that arent on insurance or should be the same price as those who are on insurance
schools should really emphasize on teaching students about health care so they can know how the system works and how things are process and what benefits they get for having health care, even though they will sound like advertisers for many health insurance companies, the students will know what to do when applying for insurance
technology on health care should be more organized because there are those who claim that they have health care but on the system they say they are not even when the person has proof of care
if laziness is the cause for obesity then so is not taking care of your children and going to work for money that families can barely survive on
food stamps should be given to every family that at least have one person in the household working and not to those who are in the unemployed group that refuses to look for a job
every job should provide health insurance since majority are being paid minimum wage and most of their money goes to taxes anyway, theres no harm in providing health insurance to all employees
money and fees should be last on this list
I was watching this show where the hospital was switching over to a new health care procedure when admitting patients to the ER. What i say was they were only allowed  an allotted time with the doctor/patient interaction and there was a script for protocol.The doctors felt like there wasn't enough time to thoroughly asses the patient and to for some type of contact to really understand the problem. With all that being said it could be where the healthcare system is going .  
Technology has come a long way .
Insurance Companies are not the best . When getting into an accident the  insurance companies have a hard time covering the cost of say anything when its to help you as a customer so to better improve the insurance comp. they need to provide a class in customer service and what the comp./customer expectations are and strat from there and then be able to provide the best deals( service ) you can give to your company/patient since its all about the customer. 
Preventative care is imp. its better to start young than older because your body isnt able to heal faster and its good to be healthy
i think the education system is fine, people go to school for so long to get the maximum education in the medical field
there are too many drugs available in the healthcare system, for example, in my opinion, add and adhd are fake problems with younger children these days. theres no way 80 percent are affected. medicating children with such high doses so they will sit still is wrong
the more the government helps out the unemployed, the less motivated they become
The people should not depend on the government for everything
There are already fitness grams at school to determine whether or not a child is considered obese, but instead of one a school year the school should follow up with a couple more times to see improvement.
Yes, schools have gym time but that is usually 30 minutes a day and not everyday. There should be more events that take place that can improve a child's lifestyle.
If a child is considered obese to due the fitness gram there should be a bigger input from the school to allow a lifestyle change. maybe a one on one with the parent and changing eating habits and exercise routines.
School lunches have improved dramatically. There used to be chips, sodas, and jello. I'm not saying the food is perfect now, but there could be more salads and a wider variety of fruit to be thrown in.
I think informing children about health education at an early age will decrease the obesity rates in America.
also if the parent is obese and uninformed about health education they are putting their child at risk.
Taking a little time out of your day each day will improve your health
if obesity is the cause for the terrible service, fees, and non benefits for health care then just make food products free to those who can not afford it at all that has a full family with at least one person in the household working
schools should feed the students for cheaper fees and also feed them healthier stuff like vegetables instead of majority processed meat that is really unhealthy for everyone, especially kids with weak metabolism
since majority of the vegetables at food markets are thrown away because they can no longer be sold at a certain date, they should be donated to schools for the better and not waste food
fast food companies should follow regulating health rules if they want to prevent and decrease obesity in america
a friend of mine who works at lubys was attacked for arguing with a customer who was being difficult and stubborn about the prices and food combos that was offered, my friend didnt hit back or anything and her managers didnt do anything at all to help her, health insurance should always be provided at every job since theres always a chance that a stubborn customer will resort to violence
if people hosting them or moderating them were more motivated, students and kids would also be motivated to participate in such events
every kid loves going outside instead of staying in a classroom all day sitting around and working on work that they know they will not put full effort into it
and also our immune system gets weaker as we grow older
only if they give out unhealthy and inedible food, which they shouldnt be doing to them
Children should be more informed about the health at an early age to prevent from any conditions that could lead u;p to it.
Americans should be well informed and updated with what is going on
Although the government can somehow help us in ways if we cannot afford, we should not ALWAYS rely on government.The government is already in enough debt.
People should try to have health insurance. Theres always unexpected things happening to peoples each and every day.
Those who cannot afford health insurance should still be cared as if they had it as well for they are still paying for the cost.
Doctors are important. Nurses are important. All medical staff members should be treated equally even if they have more experience.
Definitely agreed.
thats what the news and commercials for selling health cares are for but they focus too much on wanting a buyer
if we take away majority health care programs then it would solve some problems but the reasons we have more is that because if there are too many on one health care program, others might not be able to get the same amount of treatment or service that the others have that they need
i think health care programs and anything related to the government that makes these programs should not make us, the people, personally pay for those programs and instead take it out from our taxes
with that being done, immigrants and other non citizens of the united states would also be cared for in a different program that they will pay a small amount for while working to get their citizenship if they are planning to start a new life in the united states
if the united states did not have any health care programs, i think the world would be a better place well better as in more motivated and employed people
well maybe, many will either die from malnutrition or unattended paid treatment and such but i think it will make people look for jobs and be more mindful about themselves instead of always relying on the government to help them all the time
Agreed. We can often at times be lazy especially when we have resources out there. Some of us takes the easy way out. instead of the long and difficult way.
Yes definitely agreed. When I was in highschool, many people did not try and often lied about the results. Some high school teachers are not strict either when it comes to those fitness grams that happens per year.
It all depends on the parents too. If the parents are aware of what food are being served daily and do not want their kids to be munching on them, then they should have an alternative lunch like by bringing their own sack filled with healthy foods if they care.
Little things matter in life.
Healthy habits start at home. If the parents are informed and willing to learn and take action for their own health then that attitude will have a trickle down affect on the kids. This will ensure that children will learn and possibly love who they are as a person and are more willingly to take care of themselves because you only have one body.
technology is improving tremendously i was researching how far we have come from using technology in the healthcare system and it has come a long way.They have machines where your able to see a persons body in 2 shots with a click of a button.
Services at the emergency are ok but it could be better. THe employees that are in the front of the building to greet people could use a training course on how to handle others and such things. HOw you talk to people is a reflection about who you are as a person and it shows what type of people work for the company and all in all you may loose business because of it.
agreed. I am guilty of doing the bare minimum in the fitness grams. In my opinion it was stupid because I was already on a varsity sports team all throughout high school so I did not need to do an extra practice in the middle of school. In order to motivate people more they should break it up into smaller groups because it was easier for some of the out of shape people to blow it off because they didn't want to put effort and fail in front of everyone
Because schools basically serve cardboard food for lunch, majority of the kids, whether they drive or not, go off campus and eat cheap fast food. no matter how many restrictions you put on it they will find a way to leave to go out to eat for lunch. To solve this, schools should get a better tasting as well as nutricious food menu for the kids to choose from
kids used to stay and eat at school when they had fast food as an option. Simple. only serve healthy items under a certain calorie mark but the fast food label in the school cafeteria will draw the students in and keep them there. there are plenty of healthy foods served at fast food restaurants
gym class was always so boring, if they enforced games outside or inside that kept the kids constantly active running around and having fun then it wouldnt seem like a work out
agreed, the amount of machines in a hospital is amazing. they have everything
During gym class it always seemed like there was a game or activity being played that let other kids dominate. For example, the coaches would pick soccer or volleyball where only a couple of kids were good, and others either felt embarrassed or not good enough. Games should be played where everyone has an advantage and no one feels left out.
It would be cool if schools would put up nutrition and fact charts around the cafeteria or lunch line to show what the bad food does to them and what are the advantages of the healthy food.
Coaches should take into consideration that not all students are athletic and not every child is at the same level. They should try to make everyone feel like welcome and not allow anyone to feel ashamed that they can't do what other more athletic kids can do.
This is true. I would leave school all the time because the cheese on the pizza would literally fall off in one piece.
The school shouldn't entirely get rid of all bad food. If healthy food is served all week then the children can get a reward such as chocolate cookies, jello, or a small slice of cake. Nutritionists will even tell you not to totally get rid of bad food because that will just make you crave it even more.
Sometimes people always think a pill will fix everything. It has been engraved in our heads that if we take this certain pill everything will be okay. It seems like in the later part of this century that all these conditions have been popping up...it just seems like no one in the previous centuries had the problems we did.
better and more sufficient payment plans to pay off doctor and hospital bills
i know that generic brand prescriptions arent as good as the name brand, for example the medicine people take when having theiroid disease, so maybe making the generic just as good as the name brand would help.
being able to schedule doctor appointments online would cut down on time in the waiting room
i dont know if doctors are already made to go back to school after so many years of work, but they should have to go to some kind of semester long class every 10 years to learn new and updated medicine and practice
i feel that mental health should be tested when getting and renewing your drivers license or any kind of state issued ID
maybe make a general app for smart phones that can be used to schedule appointments
insurance should cover all surgeries if the surgeries are necessary/mandatory. i know that getting your tonsils out isn't covered by insurance because they find it isn't necessary, but for some cases it may be. they shouldn't be able to put a general NO to surgeries, it should be decided individually for each case.
For as the education aspect of health care, there should be more internships in the medical field for the students who are interested in health care. Reason being, by shadowing the physician you not only gain experience but you get the one on one hands on activity close to the physician and interacting with the patients no matter the unit you are assigned too.
A paid internship wouldn't be bad either not only are you gaining experience and interacting with patients but you are getting paid to do something that is of interest to you and that you have a passion for.
I agree there should be payment plans where you can pay for example 20 dollars or less a month until your payment is paid off in full being that you are at a doctor's office or a hospital setting.
Exactly, to no extent all surgeries should be covered especially if it is an emergency and you don't have the finances to cover the surgery in full I believe the ethics aspect of a physical are in to place where they should have some type of compassion to cover patients that not only can't afford surgeries but coverage for all patients period.
I find it quite mind boggling to know that some people are selling generic brands of different medicines for example a type of medicine for cancer and shipping it to America being that, a women in china was labeled a fraud for smuggling drugs such as a drug for cancer and she has a lab in America and the medicine is made there and placed on shelves in the pharmacy's which is really sad so people really need to be careful with dealing with medicine now days getting the actual brand is more on the save side but as stated previously, you really have to pay careful attention now days because drugs that are smuggled in to America look like the exact pill quite scary but very informational to know the difference and be aware of the difference types of medicines to take for different reasons.
Since technology is basically taking over globally as well as nationally that wouldn't be such a bad idea to do. That definitely saves time for as calling on your lunch break to schedule an appointment by phone or email, I believe the different hospitals and doctor's offices should really look into the app for smart phones.
True enough especially knowing a lot of people like to drive under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. A mental health screening wouldn't be such a bad idea not only categorizing drugs or alcohol but you never know by getting that mental health screen there can be something so minor or major you wasn't aware of and you can go to the doctor or hospital to get that special need taking care of for instance pregnancy, skin disease, chicken pox, or even diabetics that didn't know you had and is diagnosed with diabetes.
this seems like a great idea but the app may tend to have glitches and can have technical problems. And also people come and go so not everybody will know that this app exsist and not everyone has a smart phone and has access to this app. the doctors time he spends with his patients varys so he may not always be on time for the next patient thats why there are so many people waiting in the waiting room. everyone has their own clinical problems but if the doctor can at least spend with each patient for 30 minutes it will help with the waiting time for the other patients.
generic brand contain most of the same ingriedents as the original prescription. the reason there are generic brands is because of the obvious that it is cheaper and easier to get access to, as over the counter medications. many drugs are now becoming more afordable because it is over the counter. the down side is some people use drugs as recreational use. i believe that pharmacist should become more stricter when people go and buy medications that are over the counter to restrain the people of using it as a recreational drug. 
Everyone should have the same health care to cover medical needs. Just the financial aid depends on your income and other expenses you pay. People should have the same oppurtunity in receiving health care needs.
government programs such as Care Now are available to everyone. These programs should be more advertised so people can go and seek medical attention. And if there problem is severe the people that work for care now should find the nearest and cheapest doctor to see their problem.
I agree. they probably go to seminars with other doctors worldwide and get their updated information through there. And if they don't, they should make up seminars for these doctors to go to.
Going to the dentist office can get very pricey just depending on what you need to get done. These dentist should have some of payment plan if you can not pay the total amount. I know when you get braces there are payment plans but even then the total amount that each person pays is not the same. So just depending on the doctor they should regulate payment plans.
I completely agree, if the word isnt spread about such programs then their benefit wont be taken. Advertising more programs wouldnt be a bad idea.
I think that also having up-to-date equipment is necessary and training doctors how to properly use them is a good idea. Most equipment doctors use are out-of-date and sometimes they encounter problems with the equipment.
I agree. All health care should also be equal price, no matter if you have different medical insurances.
Maybe they can also offer discounts to clients that are in medical need regularly.
There should also be a designated time as to how much time a doctor should spend in the room with the person in need, so the person in need wont feel like the doctor is rushing out of the room. That way they can actually ask the doctor all the information they want to know.
I agree. You cant rule out surgeries you think arent eligible for coverage.
Waiting lists seem to be a problem as well, therefore, we should also try to expand hospitals, or at least create more.
Drug companies should have to account for how much is spent on R&D vs how much is spent on marketing to justify the cost of any drug.
Drugs that are safe should be made OTC sooner to lower the cost
Doctor's malpractice costs should be capped, both by limiting court judgements and insurance premiums, to lower healthcare costs
The government should offer a basic healthcare coverage policy to all Americans regardless of employment or income level.
Americans should be able to use the healthcare provider of their choice to improve the quality by keeping it competative
The money spent on marketing healtcare options and prescription drugs should be redirected in the system
People who can afford it (the wealthy) should be incouraged to self insure
companies should be incouraged to self insure their employee through government inscentives.  This should also make them for competative by attracting more & better employees
Some of the red-tape for healthcare providers should be streamlined.  When having surgery, they have to spend a lot of time going over repetative liability waivers which wastes time and resources
Insurance companies should be better regulated and not making such outrages profits for what little they do to make healthcare better
The way it is now the people on either end (poor & wealthy) have the most government assistance
The move from large metropolitan hospitals to smaller regional facilities is a move in the right direction because it provides more access, higher quality, and is more cost effective
The branding of pharmaceuticals drives the price up with marketing and other things.  All Rx should go straight to the generic.
i agree. generics are the same chemical compounds and have the same effectiveness as the name brand.  The difference is that other companies can not make the generic as long as the company with the name brands patent is in effect.  This is to reward them for the R&D required to develop the drug.  But I'm afraid those companies spend more on marketing than R&D and that they are making profits way beyond either the R&D or marketing costs
Eventhough specialist have spent more on education, the difference in what they make & what the GP makes for seeing more of the population is unreasonable.  I don't believe in price fixing either by the gov't or insurance companies, but there has to be some way to bring their incomes more in line
Mental health has to be more of a priority at the most basic levels of healthcare because of it's impact on general health and well being
Additional healthcare cost for people with undiagnosed/untreated depression could be reduced
this is a good idea, it would create more jobs also, but the downside is that it may increase prices of medical expenses because there will be more doctors to pay and hospitals/doctors offices to keep up
should send papers home to be read over and signed before arriving the day of surgery.
i know for a fact that some generics arent as good quality as the name brand. so in the case of your health, its better to spend the money on the name brand when needed. you should do a lot of research and talk to your doctor before using generic Rx brands
we cant punish those who make more money, wanting what they have should be a reason to work harder and i think pushes some people to achieve better things for themselves in life.
a solution may be to add on to hospitals, expand and add a few doctors and staff instead of building whole new hospitals, this might cut down on the cost but help with time spent waiting.
agreed, some people may take advantage of this system though and "forget" to pay on time, so maybe setting regulations like if you miss payment twice then you have to come up with the payment in full for all medical expenses. if this happens more than 2 times, then you wont have the ability to use the payment plan option
if able to make full payment at time of surgery or doctors visit, they should encourage patients to do so.
More aerobic classes should be added to the hospital setting such as cardio, calorie burn, and toning period there are some aerobic classes that are conducted in the hospital but more should be stressed in the setting of a hospital which would make people take their health more seriously which includes a whole floor only for exercises I feel would be a great idea especially if it is doctor's orders but shouldn't be limited to only the doctor's approval it would be great if you wanted to exercise what better way to do it in the hospital building.
Medical bills are very expensive especially doing with the different surgeries you can possibly have some people can make their full payments on the other hand, you have to think about people that aren't able to pay in full surgeries should be exempt from payments in my own opinion like heart surgery some hospitals may allow it depending on the circumstance and some may not. Payment plans is also an option like stated before there are a lot of people that can not afford to pay in full and those that are well off can and should pay in full.
Now everything is online such as making payment plans which is useful for when you don't have time to pay at the actual doctor's office but I agree with the payment paid in full if you miss the payment twice but I would still have the payment plan option available since the option was already in affect anyway.
I would also like to build on for mental disabilities.Some or most facilities such as doctors offices or dentist offices may not have the coverage plan that the patient has. They should make an exception to them since they do have a disability and may not afford since they have other expenses to attend to.
I would personally feel intimidated, because of such location, and I would also feel that the workplace would not be taken as serious as it should be if there were a floor dedicated to exercising.
It should be mandatory to have a degree to be able to work in a doctors office. Such big responsibility has to have an education on what you are doing.
Not everyone uses up all their medications. it should be implemented to return all non-used drugs to the pharmacies, so their won't be any misuse of the drug. Also maybe by returning all non-used drug they can have like a discount or something to persuade them to return non-used drug.
I agree many individuals get the medications and dont even use them or all of it. Returning the drug to the pharmacies is a good idea because most clients end up throwing their medications away or selling it.
I agree, i know of multiple medical assistants that have done "mistakes" while working in the office because they dont have all the medical knowledge information needed.
Clinics should also be open long hours like hospitals and people shouldn't neglect clinics. If you dont have a severe problem we should recommend clinics to patients.
I agree, a payment plan is always a good idea and should be allowed to all clients that meet certain requirements though.
education is an important part of healthcare that is often over-looked or not taken far enough in depth.  teen pregnancy is a real public health issue, but teens aren't getting all of the info they need because everyone thinks information may equate to permission.  we see that they already feel they have the permission so why not give the real facts and options that are out there
we need a comprehensive basic plan to cover preventative care for everyone to improve general health & well being.  early diagnosis saves money spent on more costly procedures, good dental hygiene prevents many health problems and having more face time with patients to reinforce things like the benefits of exercise and nutrition as well as the harm of being overweight & smoking would reduce later costs to the system
if the government covered the basics, then people could get private insurance for themselves or through their work to cover more severe health needs.  need to use such plans should be reduced by better basic care and therefore the cost for such plans should be more reasonable
the trend to smaller clinics in accessible locations with more convenient hours seems to be a move in the right directions. these clinics could offer their own membership plans like a health club where you pay so much a month and you can get basic services there at a reduced price
it shouldn't just be an open floor like if you were to go to LA Fitness or something like that, they need trained specialists to help you with your specific needs, and you should only be allowed to use the amenities at the hospital if you have a doctors note. maybe have to make appointments and only so many people can be in the gym at once. so you don't feel as intimidated and you can have more time with an instructor/trainer. ex: 20 people per every hour and half. (depending on how the workout floor ends up being)
workouts should be given as "prescription" just like drugs are. physical health is just as important and the only time your required to "workout" by a doctor shouldn't be just for rehab after surgeries.
maybe have 2 sections to the gym. an open floor where people who feel comfortable can workout on their own (still need doc note) and then a more private section where only a few people at a time can work out with a trained professional that can help them, or just for the privacy. but you have to make appointments for the private section.
Prior to prescription drugs prescribed by the doctor like a large dose of some kind should only be prescribed once and only once especially drugs in the type 1 category like morphine or something of that nature sometimes patients abuse the privilege of taking high dose drugs and do other personal things with them.
I agree like for instance, some patients or even schools are now afraid to talk about topics such as teen pregnancy and using protection in the fear that the teens or people from middle to high school might think its okay to try certain things if it is being addressed already. Children(depending on age) on up to teenagers need to be informed on certain things if it isn't already addressed at home first that way they are more educated about the topic and more likely not to engage in such activity.
It would be nice to exempt certain surgeries for payment but that is not the way the system is set up that's why insurance comes in handy but not everyone has insurance and for the ones that don't surgery is very expensive and would really be a burden on some that can not afford to pay off the expenses.
I agree. But it would be hard because the patient may not take initiative and go exercise, like some patients sometimes skip medications, the patients might "skip" and not workout.
senior citizens should have a basic payment plan for their own healthcare since they are receiving social security money every month.
People are very hesitant on going to the doctor when they are not feeling well, what should be done is make it mandatory to go to the doctor like every three months for a checkup and it will make them not be so hesitant the next time they actually do get sick.
This would be hard to do since doctors and nurses also do have at home responsibilities. But it is probably that doctors to have an email and patients can regard any questions they have and send them an email.
completely agree, most teens arent aware of all the outcomes of sex, they think that if they use protection they'll be safe from any diseases or pregnancy. I understand most parents dont want the school to teach sex ed. but action needs to be taken with all the baby bumps going around high schools and even now middle schools.
We can also monitor hospitals to see how the nurses are treating patients, how doctors perform, etc. Even with cameras, a lot goes on in hospitals that most people neglect. Hospitals are working environments where you need to have a fast working pace.
Thats true most clients are hesitant to go to the doctor and tend to wait until the symptoms they are feeling worsen and by then the problem they might encounter can become very severe.
There are already programs at the major pharmacies for returning non-used Rx because of the negative environmental impact to the water supply.  Obviously, there needs to be more/better publicity for these services.  Possibly a small incentive like discounts or coupons would get more ppl to participate
Building on this, there should be an incentive plan for those who engage in healthy behavior.  For those ppl that take advantage of such exercise facilities, they should get free/discounted basic preventative services from the facility.  Engaging in healthy exercise should make them need less advanced healthcare.  The free/discounted additional medical services would be another incentive to engage in the exercise.  They would have to actually use the exercise facilities not just belong to receive the reward
There would have to be an incentive because insurance companies most likely would not want to cover such Rx eventhough it would be to there advantage saving payments for more costly procedures later on.
The inconvenience and expense have an impact on ppl waiting sometimes longer than necessary.  A triage system like used in emergency rooms might help when making appts for a gp.  Maybe having a nurse practioner see more of the less severe cases at a reduced rate.  Many facilities already use a nurse practioner for screening but i don't know if pt are aware or if there is much of a discount
Providing easily accessable, inexpensive services at the most basic levels and making the public aware of the availability seems key to reducing costs for more severe, expensive services later on.
I think there should be tax breaks for physicians who find actual cures for low income patients with health problems. For example if a physician can get a diabetes 2 patient off of meds (although it is not curable) to where the patient has been educated and has their disease under control or managed- government should give physicians tax breaks on this because it would cost government less to pay for a low income persons meds.
I don't believe much money should be spent on those with mental disabilities. Although research is good and maybe we can find ways to prevent peoples mental conditions, how much help are we really to those people and how much are they a help to society? I think if government and tax payers are going to spend money they should spend money on people who will be of some profit to society. 
Child Protective Services shoukld be monitroed more closely because they always seem to force feed kids with pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants. I can only imagine how much money is spent trying to cure a kids negative experiences through drugs that never solve the problem. CPS' budget for meds should be cut so they can find better solutions that cost less.
I think you should decide if you want health insurance. Thats an extra expense that is ridiculous and doesnt help us at all when we are alreadys truggling to pay bills in a hurting economy. Natural Selection- Not everybody is meant to survive.
If you dont have insurance a ride to the hospital in an ambulance is $1000 thats ridiculous. It doesnt seem logical that a ride to a local hospital is wortht that much. Ambulances, emts, firefighters, are funded by city taxpayers. A drive to the hospital does not inconvenience the city or cost enough in gas for that.
Government should give taxbreaks to insurance companies that are willing to cover costs of chiropractic care and other modes of medicine/health .
free emergency healthcare should not be made available to patients 85 and older
If you think about it... why waste money on people that are really close to death.
What if government were to take a big part of the budget towards healthcare and apply it to promoting/helping organic agricultural busniess. The biggest problem in americais due to what we are eating. We're not diseased because our conditions are bad, but because our food is not whole.
Preventative care should be the main focus of healthcare.  It is easier to prevent someone from contracting a disease than to try to cure one.
I think that pharmaceutical companies should allow more drugs that can cure diseases to go under clinical trials than worrying about the fact that cures do not make money.
Physical education should also be improved because lack of funding towards it is another reason why people are contracting things such as high blood pressure and diabetes at younger ages.
Healthcare should also be focused on helping everyone and not just the vast majority.  Not all medications work for everyone.
Healthcare should be focused more on it's own country more than on others.  Charity starts at home.
Vaccinations should be more readily available to the public.
Healthcare should be more focused on the young.
Healthcare research should focus more on artificial transplants.  This would significantly decrease our need for organ donors.
Emergency response time should be equal in all neighborhoods and not just the ones that are affluent.
The age to enter into medicare should be increased due the fact that people are living longer.  The average lifespan for a human is no longer 72 but 83.  Also this will stop companies from dropping their employees from group coverage as soon.
The government should increase the requirements to pass physical education classes instead of allowing children to become so doughy.  I don't think providing a rope or a jungle gym is that expensive.
A basic health insurance should be mandatory for every citizen. Every citizen should have the right to be checked by a doctor and to get help when he or she needs it. The heritage and the financial income can not be problems to get a health insurance for every citizen.
Healthcare should be focused on everybody. There should not be a specific age boarder. Everybody is created equal so everybody deserves equal healthcare.
The healthcare system should look how healthcare systems in other countries working. In Germany is a health insurance mandatory and this is right. Life is not predictable and every day something bad can happen to everybody. Because of this, the U.S needs a mandatory health insurance. This insurance should cover everyday problems like sports injuries or financial support for people with eyes disabilities. For people who want to be covered better is still the opportunity to pay more and get more.
Every person has the same rights. Everybody deserves perfect healthcare until his last heartbeat.
The society should get more informed of current sicknesses in their districts.
We are living in the time period of globalization. Today, nobody can really say what home is. If the number of sick people is going to be decreased then there also going to be advantages in the U.S. The society should create a global healthcare network on all continents.
A global healthcare network should be established to help for example foreigners during vacation in other countries. In addition, all healthcare documents on earth should be written in the same language and should be in the same form.
There is no bias in repsonse times, it depends on the circumstance, if you live 30 miles from a hospital and or fire station, it will take longer to receive medical attention than if you lived just 5 miles away.
I agree. if I agree. i work at a health club and insurance companies actually cover the membership costs for their members. There are age requirements for these types of programs. If the Government can give better tax breaks to these insurance companies, it could help with directing the spending towards getting our youth into health clubs and a more active lifestyle.
But this is a fallacy, that everything in the world, if equal, would work best. But as history has shown, when something grows to large and can no longer be controlled, it always collapses in on itself. Why decrease our healthcare benefits which have been worked for and earned by my forefathers, and give them to someone else who maybe has not earned them, or due to circumstance and bad luck has never received them. I look out my family and nation before any other, and taking away some benefits from myself and my family and giving them to others who have no right to them is just wrong, at least without my consent.
I couldn't agree more but the root of the problem to this whole discussion is money. its not possible to get everyone the perfect healthcare plan.
We already have a system put in place called Medicaid, in which those who cannot afford services can receive them, on the taxpayer dollar. Why do we have to instead effect the privatized system? Those who receive medicaid do so off of the taxpayer, typically putting nothing in return back in, and costing taxpayers millions. Why effect directly those who can afford their own insurance? Giving equality to patients in deciding which doctors to see, this being Socialist! Also punishing doctors who take payment privately. If i have more money, and work harder, or maybe even am a little luckier, I should see whichever doctor I can afford. If I do not make enough to see that doctor, then I have to tough up and see the next one, and so on until I can afford one. This is how the world works, you get what you pay for. So everyone who cannot afford a nice car should be given a nice new Mercedes? Why? Where does the discussion end where freebies start and where they end? Keep the medical practice private, and keep the government out, they can only make things worse.
The Healthcare industry should start focusing more on the younger generation because of the increasing stat in childhood obesity. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.
This is very true. companies and the government make it more expensive to eat healthy
This should be put in the same pot as social security, and if paid for by these individuals over the span of their life, that will in the future cover their cost. Why should they be turned down if others, some not even legal in this country can receive it? This is asinine, our seniors who have paid in and worked hard, lose it all and have it given to people who have never worked a day in their life? Reform programs such as welfare and food stamps, then we can have more money to work with and begin talks on matter such as healthcare reform
Maybe, English seems to be the universal language for many things such as business, why not healthcare. The only issue that may arise with a universale system is that I would take a strong effort by all nations taking part, and if it goes the way of the E.U., then could crumble down like domino's if one decides to drop, same matter as the current Euro Crisis
Why is it so expensive just to get referred to another doctor? If someone is taken to the emergency room and cant be treated, they are referred somewhere else. That referral can be done before arriving. instead you pay a minimum of 1,000 dollars, and half of the time insurance companies do not want to pay their end.
so such as with the elderly, we should cut their benefits since they are deemed no longer useful to society? Or i guess we can have elected death panels with can decide what is or is not necessary. Only leading back to a socialist approach. These should also receive the first attention next to small children.
I understand, and see this as an issue which needs to be resolved
i know their are some benefits that healthcare companies offer if you live a healthy lifestyle. i think maybe our health insurance providers could offer some more incentives to a healthy lifestyle. maybe cheaper premiums and different kind of rewards.
Termination of other social assistance programs to fund a help care plan for those who are lower income?
I can say what home is... I live here in Arlington. I've lived in Dallas my whole life. I have a good understanding of where home is for me. I know several other people who would say the same.
Yeah unfortunately the biggest preventive STEP that we could take is in our food. There are so many loopholes in regulations though that we are still eating poison.
Yes, these ideals should always be based on what is just. It wouldnt be right if I were a kid from a hardworking yet still living paycheck to paycheck family seeing our food being taken out of our fridge and put into another family's fridge just because they make less money- The Hardworking get punished. I've lived in my truck in the past barely making enough money to survive and living without health insurance. To many people that sounds like a risk but that's the card we have been dealt and you have to learn to live within your means.
I honestly believe there is no good answer to this healthcare problem. The way this looks is, no matter what someone has to pay the price for someone else to be healthy or not sick. There doesn't seem to be a good solution.
Maybe the government should look into a way of funding eastern type medicines. There are so many stories of people being healed by going that route.
There are plenty of non affluent neighborhoods with hospitals right up the street that have long emergency response times.  I have lost a friend because of it.
That would be nice, but unfortunately there is no money cures.
Healthcare should do a better job at foreign health screenings, there are diseases and parasites that used to be extinct in this country that have come back with full force.  For example, tuberculosis was essentially wiped out but has some how become a threat in the U.S. again.
Healthcare is nearly impossible to maintain with the high number of individuals in the world today.
I agree, i too know what home is. A global healthcare system at this time will never work. Our own nation is having a hard time with keeping the post office open, let alone a new healthcare system which has already been passed. Programs such as the UN fail left and right, showing no new signs of progress in making strides in fields such as medicine. In helping these nations the west is falling, the west being the backbone to all of this. If the west falls, everything falls.
I concur, screenings for anyone who is coming into our nation from foreign zones, or places which do not have the same standards of healthcare as our own. This may seem unfair, but we cannot have our own get sick and die because someone was mad that they had to go through additional screenings before entering. Coming over into the US is not a right, but a privilege unless you are a US citizen. We owe nothing to anyone else, and likewise for others owing anything to us.
Less government short of Anarchy is what our goal should be here. Understandably there should be standards set, education of physicians and medical personnel, medications, so on and so forth. But to the point in which the government wants to compete, and directly effect the healthcare system? This is where it has gone to far. Forcing every American to buy insurance, lying by saying that the penalties of not doing so is a tax. You can read the health care plan after it is passed???? This is terrifying, that the average American will stand for this, and reelect the same individuals responsible, and their excuse, " Well at least they are trying". 40% of americans are on some form of government assistance, and the president keeps saying that things are getting better, and more and more americans are out of work, many illegals receive free healthcare, while not paying taxes. Many americans receive benefits while sitting on their -----, and not contributing in their lifetimes while everyone else has to. As said by a famous scholar, every democracy will die, once its people realize that they can elect themselves benefits, or as we may know it "freebees". There should be no discussion past regulations.
Mental disabilities are one of the biggest problems in our society. This is also a reason why in Europe are not that much killed people by weapons as in the USA because everytime when in Europe is somebody depressed he goes to the psychologists who takes care of him. This appointment is payed at least until a certain boarder by the health insurence. Here in the US this does not exist because the health insurence is not mandatory for every citizen and when here somebody is depressed he or she is just freaking out and lives his or her worst fantasies
you never know what can happen and every person who is on this earth deserves help. Also every kind of this people can develop the medicine by trying new things when the patient agrees
The euro crisis is something completely different. This is a financial politcal part where Greece cheated and destroyed everthing with the corruption.
The reason why we're in such a bind with our healthcare is because we're a take now think later society. we're spending billions of dollars on research and the use of pharmaceutical drugs. people turn to these drugs because its easy.
Another big problem is foreigners that are benefiting from free health care that American citizens are paying for. i understand they want to come here for a better life but we have to come up with some plan that forces them to contribute. too many people are looking for handouts now a days or expect someone to help bail them out of their situation
Healthcare should be treated like buying a car. you may want a 2013 Camaro but don't have the down payment or the credit score. a car dealership isn't going to give you a handout. You have to settle for something less or what you can afford or account for.
the only thing with that is, more money would have to come out of our pockets
why should we buy into this new healthcare system if congress is not? Obama was asked the question "will you and your family adopt this new healthcare plan"? He danced around the question and did not answer. Other members of congress were asked the same question and they said they will "think about it"
This will always be a problem. also Europe has cameras on almost every street corner. That is why crime and violent acts are so uncommon. I personally think that our country should really consider doing the same. Going back to health Insurance. If we dedicate more time to research on new and improved drugs for people with "mental illness", we're taking away time and money away from the leading cause of death here in the U.S., which is cardiovascular disease. This disease is one of the main reasons why our healthcare has become such a problem.
Yes but it is to big of a cost to try and help everyone. Natural selection should be considered here. We cant save everyone, especially when those being saved will not have a high quality of life if kept alive.
Thinking with your heart - won't get you anywhere in business as so with coming up with a financially responsible healthcare plan that is just.
You're right... I have a bad knee and bad shoulder but I can't afford to go to a doctor. But the last thing I want is to get a hand out. This health care stuff sucks... theres no solution
We are not living in the time of Charles Darwin anymore. It is not about who can be saved who not but it is about that every body is created equal. If we would set a boarder where we would not help anymore people with big health problems, a big corruption crisis would occur.
What if for people to get the health care they wanted but could not afford it they had to pay by community service for a government job. This would allow the govt to cut back on jobs which means less salaries to pay but then allows patients to get better care. Of course this sounds simplistic but the jobs could accomModate based on disability or whatever and is open to any kind of adjustment. At the end of the day spending has to be cut somewhere in order to provide more affordable healthcare or debt ceiling is just raised and the dollar crashes faster.  
This is the point we can not be afraid of people or work that people do who actually want to help us. If this opinion would occur at more and more people we would live in a sick society and the doctors would become unemployed.
Health insurences should be available for everybody and cover every health disability except body/beauty makeovers.
This showed the hypocrisy of our current system, do as I say not as i do. This double standard is wrong, that certain individuals because of status can opt out of a mandatory program, while others are forced to stay in, or are fined for not doing so. Why not make everyone participate, it is only fair. 
they are to an extent, but I agree, a separate government program should be in place to take care of such matters. Like welfare for example, it is there for those who need it to use, but is optional, this is the system we should have in place, and we do, Medicaid and Medicare.
Making the playing field level then, don't give one person an advantage that you would not give another. We have health issues here that must be taken care of, and until then, we need to stay focused and help our own.
But who should stripe me of this thought, and on what grounds? I feel that a group of people who have paid in, and are our elders, they need to be taken care of, not thrown by the wayside. I think that the bigger issue is that as a nation we are straying away from who we are. Granted I am thinking with my heart, but in the end it is for better not worse. Communism seems to be such a beautiful thing, common sense applied, pure perfection, but the one rule which it does not take into account? We as humans are not perfect. We cannot have a Utopia, it is against our nature.
I think we should leave our healthcare system intact at the moment, hesitating any major changes. Instead small incremental changes are necessary, something that takes time, nothing drastic and overnight, we cannot rush this. Most people do not realize that it took time to assemble such a system, with much though put into it, why not continue to do the same in regards to changing it?
The first thing they could do it lower the cost of over counter medicine. People genially pay a great amount for what the Doctor give you so they cost of medicine you can get in any sore should cost as much.
When they have to renew there persription, they should just let all the branches of the pharmacy know that they renewed it.
as far as "everyone should have healthcare" there should be a minimum line for those who can not afford it, but obviously still need a basis of care
we need a nationwide data base for when a prescription is prescribed so that drug seekers cannot get a hold of too much medicine
we need a quick fix for MRIs because we are running out of Helium which is needed for MRIs
General practitioners need a higher salary or else more and more doctors are going to specialize their field of study because the benefits are better. We don't want to run out of general practitioners
lower incomes should have access to diagnosis and prescription or shot, but not ER services or specialist appointments (like podiatrist, dermatologist, etc)
all insurances should be accepted at every general/ family doctor and walk in clinic
mental health care should be made more affordable
education for doctors (med school) should be made more affordable
one word CUba
england
and other countries that provide free healthcare
Our taxes should be going to the medical industry and not to weaponry, as we are in severe need of more public hospitals and parkland alone will not cut it
I like the universal health care system
private insurances can still be available, and should not fear the rich class, but a free healthcare is a must for the less fortunate. There shouldn't be anyone who can't afford treatment.
For America to be one of the top countries in the world, if not the best, we should have this soved ASAP
Emergency room services at the public hospital should not be hours and hours of wait time. This is something that needs to be resolved and not looked over.
Doctors should help everyone and anyone not worrying about their stats.
For example, my grandpa was in the hospital and the doctor gave up on him, but we took him to another hospital and now he is doing fine.
A reform is a  ust
it should not be rich vs poor in this matter
Although, you do have a point to a certain extent, general doctors are specialized as well. Those doctors are usually the first case of defense in 90% of the cases. They should not be paid more because they are general, they are already paid well compared to a specialized doctor as well.
That is pretty messed up to say, they have a right to live just as much as anyoen else too. I dont know if you know but people have died from skin disease and other specific diseases that an individual with specalized case can resolve.
Also, emergency services is a must hence the emergency part.
Education is the answer for the Healthcare
Also, being open minded I know for the longest Cuba has one of the worlds best healthcare system, yet we dont copy them because they are not the same polical party.
Doctors and anyone working in the medical feild should have strict supervision on how well they have bed manors.
I was with my grandpa at the hospital, and there was an indian intern who came in for respiratory treatements, and I wanted to punch him in the face.
Its true that doctors should help as many people as they possibly can, but if doctors didn't look at a person's healthcare records for payment and found out later they didn't have insurance or can't afford the care, then it may just come back on your own healthcare bill to pay for the costs. Instead of letting anyone with or without insurance get healthcare service,  the country should work towards lowering the cost of healthcare insurance itself so everybody can have an equal opportunity for care.
If more students were involved in taking job opportunities at PhysScribe Inc, or volunteered at hospitals to assist medical teams, care could be administered to patients more frequently while students did all the small and inattentive details.
It is offensive to say that those who have low incomes shouldn't have access to the ER or specialist, but I believe the other person meant that having a low income means they cant afford insurance to get that care, not that they don't deserve care. Everybody deserves care. To solve this problem, we just need to lower the healthcare cost to help those with low incomes or who can't afford insurance to get this special care as much as possible.
We also need to look at how the person's lifestyle is also if they say that they can't afford healthcare, some people can't afford healthcare but they can afford an iPhone? People like that shouldn't have the privilege of having healtcare being provided from someone else.
I feel that single mothers with children should automatically have healthcare. My sister just had a child and she was on Medicare and as soon as my niece was born she was off the insurance.
Maybe there shouldn't be a deductible.
Maybe co-pays should be lowered?
Maybe instead of all these nursing programs that you could do in a couple of months that you always see commercials for on tv they should use that money to put into healthcare.
with that maybe their medication be lowered too.
I feel that they make some machines that are unnecessary that cost a lot of money.
I agree with that, but specialization should be available if needed.
Healthcare should be nationalized
one word "cuba"
Establishment of better healthcare structure is a must.
Recognize the problem and take serious steps to improve it.
Private insurance will never go away, at the end of the day the rich should not be penalized for success.
That will not give the poor any more options. poor will not save there money for a lower copay, yet waste it and rely on help from the government.
Free healthcare should be at an adequate level, not there just for looks.
WELL cuba is actually the worlds leading healthcare, so not just any country.
If the government made one small change to general finances, a ripple effect could be made. For instance, if the government decided to put more money towards education, more students would arise with affordable college tuition. With more students, there's a higher chance of healthcare staff. Increase in hospital staff, increase in patient health and care production. Great production, then increase in hospital income, and finally prices on machines would be more affordable and cut backs would be made on health insurance for patients.
yes maybe rearranging our taxes or where america is spending their money would help provide for cheaper or maybe free healthcare
Maybe we could resolve this by making the education cheaper for those who work in the ER or prompt them with better benefits so that their late hours and stressful jobs will be worth while and more people would apply for that carreer
encouraging and rewarding college student volunteering is a good idea. It could make the system more efficient without putting in extra costs.
it doesn't mean their skin disease can't be taken care of. Its more like curing acne or getting cosmetic work done that shouldnt just be given out for free. I'm simply saying, we need more general practioners that have a wide range of intelligence on different diseases because sending people to a specialized doctor is more expensive and our government doesn't have that kind of money for every poor person out there.
to specify, single mothers WITH LOW INCOME should have access to healthcare. not just any single mother. But does this not create problems? Like what about single fathers with children?
It is easy to notice the close doctor-patient relationship going away in these times, so yes I think this would be great for America to just make the experience more enjoyable.
Yes, we need to find a way to really regulate who can afford this and who cannot. I know somebody said this shouldn't be a matter of rich or poor but if you can afford to have healthcare insurance, then you should get it.
They should make machines that can make things go faster in the ER. On a recent episode of Grey's Anatomy they have a machine that can take a full body x-ray in 13 seconds. Can cut down on wait time.
yes but that why would argue the fact that we need them to lower the prices for health care and on insurance.
Yeah we should think about single parents!!
the reason they don't have a wide range is to get money they are people to just like us they need the money to survive. I get what your saying but that's a lot to put on a doctor to know about the sink an know about the organs, and the eyes. Their only a few doctors left that probably do  have a wide range and because of that they are not affordable for everybody.
I don't think we will ever change how long we wait people get hurt everyday. Unless the doctor is bad you would be waiting
Yes we do. I know of someone that had given false information because she really needed to go to the hospital and she didn't have papers. Maybe we should think of a better way to check information because someone has to pay for those costs.
I've heard, don't quote me, that once the Obamcare starts that you will penalized and have to get the government insurance which is better than some insurances and cheaper. Why don't we all just get that insurance. I fell like it would just make things so much easier with just one insurance for everyone.
Maybe more free clinics? Cause I know that they can get really packed and maybe people don't want to wait and maybe that's how emergency rooms get over crowded and we have to wait a while.
I know from my families jobs that people go to the ER for seemingly ridiculous things. Perhaps we could screen these people out to avoid unneccesary wait time and spending
i think it is just a matter of getting more people and bigger facilities. We just have to find a way to get the money
money is an issue to have better technology takes a lot more money. Figuring out where to get this money is the next big step
What is a free clinic? You mean walk-in clinic/minor emergency clinics? Your idea is a good point. A good way to fix the wait time is to give higher pay for general practitioners. Most doctors specialize because they get paid so much more, but minor emergency clinics just use general doctors. If we could pay them more, we would have more doctors to get patients through faster
If it took less money to take care of people, then insurance costs could be lowered. But the insurance has to get their money from somewhere to pay for all the bills going to them too.
what?
I agree, we know what needs to be done, but getting there needs to be solved. The best way to get the money is to cut back on government security and defense funds by solving national relationship issues, and inputting this difference into the healthcare system to increase medicaid and medicare availability.
I dont think lowering the coist oif the medicine is going to do any improvement anywhere, not everyone is a doctor
medicare taxes and well fare programs should be monitored more strictly, and not alloed for everyone
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE
more hospitals not clinics, just need organized solution.
What will that solve
universal healthcare does not degrade a doctors ability
It's the people who has been managing the money thats what the problem is
Who is it to judge on who needs insurance and who doesnt? And no prescreends will tell you that
Yes everyone needs a care and we should base the minimum to the ones who cant afforded it. Like middle class single parents or middle class in general. As we now the majority of America is middle class.
I believe it would solve the money expense on traveling to a doctor that the doctor take there insurance. If the hospital that is close by take any type of insurance;then they will not be spending money on gas as much as the doctor bill.
Now that will never happen there is not enough money in the world to take care of everyone for a cheep cost.
no just opportunist and non opportunist
Now although I don't know as much about the healthcare system as I would like, I can say that I think the main idea for the healthcare system is to help those people who cannot help themselves. This being said, I would suggest that healthcare is more flexible towards those who need it more such as the people who are living in a poor area and cannot always provide for their family. Another good idea that may help the system is to just make more people aware of the actual problems. Take me for example, I would be able to give much better ideas to help benefit this system if I was aware of its outline procedure in more detail. So far all I can tell is that the biggest problem is, who receives what from their healthcare system, so the only idea I can generate would be that you should base an individuals healthcare rewards by the persons' way of living.
You could have certain healthcare providers that check in on families that apply for healthcare and have them give a suggested amount that should be rewarded to the person(s). It would be interesting to see how much of an affect a "Healthcare Truck" would have on a society. Like if a truck were to drive around almost like an ice cream truck and offer information on healthcare to all Americans. On this truck you could also apply for healthcare and talk to representatives that can provide help to those who don't know what their doing or could be doing to make their situation better. you could maybe find a way to teach kids about healthcare in school so that they can be prepared for their future responsibilities. Healthcare giveaways over the radio or drawings (like the lottery). You can have people turn in empty medicine bottles for tickets to enter in a drawing and the winner would receive Healthcare rewards.
Well Joe Flacco just got a 120 million dollar contract for a few years to go out, play a game he enjoys, and get hurt. While the Nurse that is in over their head in education debt is getting paid garbage to put up with American's rudeness in the hospital. The very first thing we need to look at is, if we want good care, we need to take care of those providing us. Somehow more money needs to find its way to these hard working people if not money some kind of compensation for working those ridiculous hours and working as hard as they do. Having over tired burnout healthcare personal is unacceptable. If the Obama admin wants to dabble in health care, then lets pull some Gov money to the system, no reason why a car company should get billions when a hospital doesn't even get gas money for ER runs.
Prescription medication. As it stands now, I think it is fine. Everyone should not be entitled to cheap meds. You pay more for full auto insurance over just liability right? But you also are covered in more areas. With that said, if you pay more for health care that covers more, your meds will be covered. If you cant afford it, then oh well, go try harder. Americans complain and complain they had a 100 dollar co-pay. Why are you complaining, the meds cost a heck of a lot more to research, develop, get a approved... hell im not going to explain the business process here, you get it. In short, if you cant afford 100 dollars, then maybe you should look down at your feet and regret paying 98$ for those nikes you are wearing
Want to save money? Pull the plug on those on life support. I know that's mean but why are we wasting hundreds of thousand of dollars and man hours tending to someone who is going to pass anyway? Because the family has that choice i know. But change it. Allow a max of 12 months on life support.. after that the family has 2 options, pay for it out of pocket (no more insurance) or pull the plug. As of now if long term care or intense care costs to much insurance already says they will only pay for a lesser quality of care, the logical next step is to just terminate that care.
Everyone says... "oh Canada has free health care why cant we"  ok, you go to Canada and wait 5 months for an appointment and even longer to get approved for your prescriptions. Free sounds great, but if humans can not wait for 3 hours in the Doc's office can you imagine waiting 5 months to be seen? Our health care is slow with burnout staff, and out dated equipment. And this will never change for the private sector has no power on this, the only hope is Government steps. Going back to cars, there is no reason a GMC should have more technology in the dash board then the office i sit in to get my back checked out. I have no idea on how to get better technology but it is needed. It is a cost well spent, why have 3 different tests when 1 machine can answer everything.. oh thats right, so the insurance companies can make money.. so maybe that is were the Gov should step in... stop letting them rob us blind.
We need better nurses. Nurses who care more which probably wont happen without a pay raise.  We need nurses who are in the profession because of their passion to help not just for a job or the money.
Legalize assisted suicide too
Maybe we should have more education opportunities for those who dont understand that concept.
People get sick, no matter their income. We should develop a better system that helps the sick but doesn't allow a free ride either.  There's a happy medium somewhere.
More information and education in schools about leading healthy lifestyles should help our healthcare system
There should be some form of financial reward or incentive to those who lead a healthy lifestyle to encourage others to do the same
Children, elderly, and the mentally ill should be top priority in our healthcare system.
Hospitals should have better managers and more training available.
Not everyone can be "wealthy", there has to and there will be poor people.  That doesn't make anyone greater or less, so when providing healthcare to our nation we should keep in mind health before wealth.
Emergency room services get overwhelmed with people who don't have a primary care provider and take the er staff's time with colds or headaches.  We should make it possible for everyone to have at least a primary care physician and keep the er for emergencies!
America's healthcare system doesn't need as much reform as the American people's mindsets do. But adapting more positive and loving attitudes as a people could lead to an easier and less painful reform to healthcare
Healthcare insurance should be like good credit, better health better benefits (excluding preexisting conditions of course).
Better technology could make processes more productive and efficient.
Doctors should have to pass a handwriting test prior to them being allowed to write prescriptions.  That could prevent thousands of mistakes and lives being lost
Out of all government spending we should be sure that healthcare is a priority
Maybe we should cut government spending from something less important than the health of our citizens
Hospital workers don't necessarily need more money to be better, just to feel more appreciated by us.  Making someone feel appreciated could work better than just more money and people will feel like the work they do is worthwhile.
Educating the masses in a variety of areas of health care, especially the ones who are prone to make injunctions of their own health as well as potentially harming others around them, could save a lot of money. Those who are unaware of the dangers of doing too many drugs or even teenage pregnancies cost everyone around them money because they are unable to pay for their hospital expenses. Educating individuals further than the crap I've experienced throughout school would stop many of the people who do not realize the effects of their actions of society. There are people on life support who do not have family to pay for them or their own riches to keep them alive. Decisions have to be made if the technology is not available to save people. Care for elderly people, the mentally unstable, and persons with severe mental in-capabilities should not be paid for by the government and insurance companies but by the people who want them to be cared for, which in some cases there aren't any. If the disabled, physically or otherwise, are unable to or unwilling to contribute to society in any way shape or form and only hinder the progress of reform by literally and fiscally taking up space that could be used to advance technology or save more people from illness then they should be put down in order to utilize what resources we have more effectively. Doctors and psychiatrists should not be so apt to hand out prescriptions for drugs, especially with mental disorders such as depression. It creates problems not only through the patients but as well as those that need to be hospitalized for obtaining, either from buying them from the patient or stealing them, drugs and using them in manners that they were not intended to be used for. Other treatment should be used first and drugs should be seen as a last resort instead of a means of getting the patients out of the office. Possibly subsidizing more of the costs of hospital expenses could lower the costs that the hospitals themselves pay, and through that lower insurance costs and out-of-pocket expenses from the patients. People need to be more responsible, or taught to be, when it comes to health care and the costs. If an uninsured person has to go to the emergency room, there is no time to make sure that that person has health insurance, and if they do not then the rest of society has to pay for it either literally or through hospitals having to cut back on staff, technology or quality of medicine and procedures. If we explore the possibilities of advanced technology we could potentially cut back on spending by removing the need to have to use invasive and costly surgeries and therapy.
There are some insurance companies that require a full physical before the will carry you almost like a pass or fail; If you you pass with good health you get a more affordable rate. However, most people with low incomes aren't able to afford all of the necessary things it takes to stay healthy like buying Organic foods, gym memberships, and supplements, etc. So these people are forced to either pay a higher insurance rate or have none at all. I do agree that there should be an incentive to leading a healthy lifestyle and maybe if gym memberships or "healthy food" discounts were offered through our employers or insurance companies it would help aid to a healthier lifestyle where healthcare wasn't such a burden.
I think EDUCATION on preventive methods to illness would help significantly. So many of the common diseases or conditions are self inflicted and avoidable. I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism at 22 and without knowing at the time what was wrong I thought I was dying. It took me going to an OBGYN ( thinking I have cervical Cancer) to find out that my hormones were out of wack. They immediately wanted to put me on the most expensive medication they could find ( which had a whole laundry list of side affects itself). With a little digging i found that a little exersice and healthy eating would naturally turn my condition around.
This is a great idea! The main thing that the citizens need is to be educated on this topic
This might sound crazy but we could establish new "holidays" like every month is celebrating some sort of health aspect and for each month there could be sales on medications, doctor appointments, emergency room services, mental health, while also educating the people.
Educate those that are not aware how cheap it is to be healthy. Gym membership 10.95 (fitness connection) $1.89 lb of chicken breasts. Water is free, Organic is a sham, sorry but look at what the FDA considers organic, the rest is just marketing labeling, so you dont have to overpay for fruits and greens.  And supplements are an aid, (most are crap anyway) so not needed. This education of finding alternatives is pretty important i feel to help the less poor realize they have options other than hot dogs to feed the kids cause they are cheap.
Well said! People expect things on the drop of a dime. These nurses are working around the clock with some serious (insert your own word) people most of the time. ..  ... maybe it is us who is making health care bad?
I like the sounds of this, any ideas on who this would be approached? how do we keep the first time parent out of the ER cause the kid is crying louder? will there be enough providers to handle the mass workload from the ER? I would like to hear what you guys/gals have on this one, might be the most practical idea generated thus far.
not crazy, far fetched yes. How about we do away with the tradition of old holidays? We don't need to be fatting America up on Halloween and Easter with all this candy.
I do not know much on how the current insurance works, all i know is i dont have medical. What i do know is people will complain either way. I was 8 yrs military, insurance was free.. and us enlisted and spouses complained complained complained about how crappy the service was and how long it took to be seen. I think 80 percent of the people i know said "Cant wait to drop tricare and pay for my own insurance and get better care" I was one of them... here i am now... 2 years out.. no medical. Somehow insurance needs to have many plans .. heck pet insurance has silver gold and platinum, my dog has health insurance and I do not. Why can humans not have simplified levels of care?
People will complain regardless, it's inevitable.  The main priority though, should be to please the majority the best way possible.
Leading a healthy lifestyle is not as difficult as some make it seem. It takes more effort to eat healthy not necessarily more money. People who are already living off of the government with food stamps should be limited or encouraged to purchase healthier options of food.
Sounds a tad bit crazy but I agree that there should be more promotional methods to make people aware and educated.
All roads lead back to insurance.  People don't have primary care doctors because of their insurance provider or lack of.  ER rooms are packed out for a lot of things that aren't emergencies because of insurance providers or lack of.  Somehow, someway the health of others has to be prioritized over profit and capital.
We need more people interested in the promotion, education, and preventive side of health care not just the practice and providing side.  Healthcare education should be a major, with jobs in the field of educating others and promoting awareness
Technology is advancing farther and faster than education.  The two need to catch up and progress at the same pace.
It's really bad when there is better healthcare in prisons than there is available to some working class citizens   
The FDA itself is a scam and i agree there are a few less expensive alternatives to leading a healthy lifestyle but it all boils down to education.
I agree, many people don't realize and I am still learning that insurance companies run our health industry. They control what is approved by the FDA and other thing s that I don't think they should have the power to control. I still don't know much about how these companies go about having so much power over our healthcare system, but if there was a class offered to educate the masses on how corrupt this is im sure things will change.
  Maybe if schools or companies were offered some type of tax break for promoting or offering eduction on healthier lifestyles, everyone loves a good tax break.
Education is by far the most important resource that is lacking in this country and is available to those who really want it. Education could provide the inspiration needed for individuals to lead healthier lifestyles, and also the aspiration to do so and to be less of a burden on society as well.
I agree. Insurance needs to be simplified and dealt better. However, I think it is more the company's faults. It needs to be straight forward without any loopholes or catches that make it difficult to process. But I do not believe it should be given by the government for every individual. The rich pay for the better healthcare just as we all choose to pay for the cheaper or full coverage on auto insurance.
This could be a good idea. But instead of holidays perhaps just an event or big hoopla where there are a host of competitions and contests concerning healthy lifestyles and making good choices and have doctors and other qualified people talk about the benefits there are to being more active and healthy.
I agree that technology is advancing faster than education, but on the societal aspect. There is a major gap between those who create the newer and newer technology and the consumers and general population. I think its fine that technology is ahead of education, however the gap should not be as wide as it is and it should not be growing at the same rate.
There should be no reward for not being lazy. It should be a societal responsibility to not be lazy in any aspect of life, especially in aspects that concern the individual personally, and through them, financially, the rest of society. However there could be one for encouraging others and picking them up and motivating people to do better than average.
I agree. Prisons should not be the great place that it is made to be today. Through prison reform we could clear out the individuals who do not deserve to be there and through that reduce medical costs. With less prisoners there would be less fights which would lead to less surgeries, drugs and care needed for individuals who broke the law and are supposed to be punished.
Giving up control of medical costs, insurance and finances to the governmental regulation could be the most effective way to ensure that health of the country's citizens comes before profit because most corporations will not.
I see that there are similarities throughout this entire thread of ideas. After reading everyone's ideas it's obvious that what we need is education on health/healthcare system, even distribution of money in FAIR ways to both the people receiving care and the hospitals/staff running these procedures, and to somehow get the rich to be more considerate of the poor. In the end it's hard to say that these are at all possible to achieve (with there being so many people in the world). Maybe education on the subject could spark the fire.
"Put down" as in you put down a horse or some animal?  That's terrible, if you ever became seriously disabled or had a disabled child would you still feel the same?  It's easy to suggest somethings because they won't affect you.  I don't think dehumanizing mentally unstable or elderly people is a great solution.
In all honesty, being healthy has to be "so easy a caveman can do it" before Americans are motivated to exert much effort.  Unfortunately, we just live in a day and age that if it doesn't come fast and easy, most Americans don't want to do it.  The mentality of our people needs to be reformed.  We need to get back to the days where everyone put in an effort to make this nation better.  Now people just want to sit back and tell the government to fix everything.
It starts with our children.  People past the age of 30 are stuck in their ways and harder to educate for this reason.  If we could begin to raise more conscientious children, we could see a change in the mindset and health of America.
This is where technology plays the villain.  No one plays outside anymore, tv's got bigger and so did the people.
Like Ny is doing, regulate what people consume, i mean who really needs 3 64oz big gulps. But lets not have Govnt step in and do this, have business do it themselves and get a reward on tax break or something. For example how subway (yes NOT healthy) made apples and water along with the less fat/carb chips. It nothing big but its a start. So if other business would follow we could lead to a healthier America.  STOP SELLING TRIPLE BACON CHEESEBURGERS WENDYS!!   (but sooo tasty)
What about modeling the ER like the DMV. You go to a computer, choose why you are there "Flu like" "broken bone" "back issue" "who the heck knows" Let certain nurses deal with said cases, to help stream line the process. Steam line is bad you say... not when over 80% of the people in the ER do not need to be in the ER its a good filter.
Prescription meds.... there needs to be a low low does of these meds that are "over the counter" If i have strep throat why must i go to the doc just to get him to sign his name so i can get what i need. Having the ability to buy a antibiotic or other useful drug at a low dose will keep many people out of the docs office.
Ship all the sick to Guantanamo  HA sorry i just could not resist. 
Once a month home visits ... heck the Govnt is losing millions in the post office so why not have a traveling doc for 100 bucks per visit you can be seen if you do not have health care? Shoot let the Doc ride with mail man, knock out 2 in one.
Pass a bill so that no matter how much the budget is cut health care can not be touched... Or lets stop giving Israel, Egypt, Africa ..millions a day in "aid" and put that toward our own people!! We can complain about Americans but its Gov that is control of the funds without the money what can be done?
What do you mean here? and example please
Even if our children are smart about health, what if they cant afford the insurance, (student or bad job) and its a reason to visit the hospital due to .. oh i dunno a reason outside of their lifestyle choice.... but no insurance.. how does this fix anything.
Insurance lottery, your number gets drawn that month you get a discount on a visit
Equip hospitals the way they should be regardless of their size. Example : My father just went for broke ribs/puncture lung   no insurance.... Ambulance ride there, they could not see him, so then took him to 2nd place, no room, third place they put him in ICU. He had 3 rides... 3 rides he will be billed for even tho it was not his choice. Every place needs to be ready for anything. Good job Greenbay
I agree that in a perfect world EDUCATION would be the answer to many problems in the healthcare system but haven't we tried that already? The information on what it takes to be healthy is out there on websites, books, and tv  ( all of which are accessible regardless of income). Throughout grade school it was required for me to take health classes so the information for self education is out there. however, many people choose to ignore this or choose to remain ignorant. 
Then if the people are unwilling to do something about their own health the government or some other private organization will have to do it for them with or without their consent. And if they are uneducated then it would be without their consent in order to do what is best for them.
These people are stuck in their ways are teaching the children of today. If we want to change education of the "future of america" then we would need to reform more than just healthcare in order to take care of healthcare. In order to be a teacher you need a 2.0 gpa? Ridiculous.
If the children were smarter about healthy lifestyles then there would be less unnecessary doctor visits which waste time and money and be less at risk for disease and accidents and we would be able to spend that money on those who need it.
They make bigger hospitals for that reason. What should be done is emergency response teams should be able to make the call as to which hospital to go to before they decide on one place, if the patient is stabilized enough to have the couple of minutes available to do so.
This could be a good idea. A traveling doctor or team of specialists could go around making house-calls providing insight and expertise or even write prescriptions and treatment to those that are sick but do not need to go to a hospital and would clear up space for those that do.
If I couldnt do anything for myself and relied on everyone completely? Yea i would want to be put down. Why should society be responsible for footing the bill of those who are unable or unwilling to help? Who need 24/7 round the clock care so they don't choke on their spit? If the members of the family are willing to care or willing to pay for it then by all means let them.
 ;D
Doctors should be employ by hospital and not work with hospital on contract basis. Maintenance medications should be below $5.00 for a month supply Laws should be made to reduce the rate that medical providers are getting sued unless negligence is involved on the part of the medical provider. programs should be setup in order to educated the patient on how to effectively take their medications at home Programs should be setup in order to allow healthcare providers to followup with patient on regular basis to make sure that recurrence  of health problems are reduced. Pharmacist should not be allowed to work for very long hours in order to improve accuracy of pharmacist Very busy hospitals and retail pharmacist must employ adequate number of staff in order to avoid medical errors.  
A lot of laws should be made in order to protect the patients against insurance company. Laws should be made in order to allow doctors to spend more time with their patients. More stringent rules should be made to abide pharmaceutical companies and prevent them from over pricing medicine.
the cost of mediciations should be reduced, as we need medication for the smallest things.
the cost of visiting a doctor should be reduced. Office visit fees should either be taken off or reduced.
after seeing a doctor for your medical issues, there should be a onling 24-7 chat with either a doctor or a nurse. Or at least some sort of email so that the doctor can respond right away.
Some pharmacies charge an extra fee to order medication. Why is that? That shouldnt be needed.
Doctors should follow up not with only visits but also phone calls as some cannot afford a follow up visit.
The cost of x-rays should be reduced.
there should be a 24-7 clinic in every city. And they shouldnt charge extra just because it is one. Health is Health.
cost of emergency room bills shouldnt be 14,000 for just 1 day! thats ridicoulous.
More security systems and privacy should be added into offices of healthcare providers and hospitals.
I've heard in UK you get braces for free?! why cant US do that?
The first issue I belive to be the root problem would be the finiancial sector. The cost of medicine in this country is way overpriced for many citizens. The fact that medical insurance companies can have total control on how much to spend on an individual, this is bad for every citizen. So, I belive there should be a sort of saftey net that covers all citizens from fraud, protecting the consumer. If everybody is covered for the bare minimum of healthcare this would increase life expentecy in the United States.
insurance companies shouldnt have a miniumum deductible. whats the point of even having insurance then?
I agree, i feel that these companies get away with that stuff because they are not challenge. I think that the prices in the US for medication are not what they really are. In the UK the same medicine costs about half the price;if not more, in medication.
The cost of going to medical school should be reduced. There are many students who decide not to go into the medical field because of school costs. If the costs would change. we would have more doctors. Many people cannot afford such high costs. If we need more doctors then why not reduce the cost of medical school by some?
health is most important. there should be no reason why the prices of medicine need to be high. Theres other things that could be at a higher price but why medicine? Isn't that what it takes for us to survive in this world?!
Having medicaid and chips still isnt decently cheap or at a good price.
A government watch on the healthcare system would be nice. I don't belive that their is an actuall government entity that looks over healthcare in general. I know the FDA does oversee it somewhat, but i believe that section is the only part where government can't step in, just in case it goes south, or they're doing something illegal.
we pay a lot of money for doctors. The availability of them should increase.
Maybe a sort of government program every once in a while, where they'll give more money to MED students. To encourage more student enrollment. That would help, but under current circumstances the problem would be where to get that money.
the cost of lab reports, x-rays, pre screenings, all should be reduced.
I know some do that, but most don't, should they be forced, or maybe get nurses on their as well.
The cost of the techology should be helped, and reduced. one reason why healthcare is so expensive is that the machines that could save our lives, costs the hospitals millions of dollars, which in turn causes them to raise their cost to treat a patient.
I also say give more responsibilties to nurses. Let them take control sometimes, just as long as their properly trained. I know most nurses with an MBA can pretty much do everything doctors can do, except prescribe medicine.
We don't have universal healthcare,yet.
yeah, exactly. I hate how they're paid less than doctors. Usually its them doing more.
this is quite true, at times there are people who are in dire need of medications for a certain amount of time, but are unable to keep on purchasing them due to their high costs
a way in which money could be balanced out in the field of education would be dealing with the amount of money that a school is given. Schools are at times given large amounts in which to buy necessary things for its students, but blowing it on two thousand dollar computers isn't the answer. It could have easily have bought two to three times as many with that amount from a different brand.
because i'm pretty sure that they are paying higher taxes than we are
there are certain pharmaceuticals in which are given at high prices when a person's medical condition is pretty bad, such as medications for patients that are diagnosed with cancer. Prices range in the hundreds and only last for a couple of weeks up torwards a month. Its things like these that aught to be checked with, because whats the point of patients taking kemo-therapy if due to the high prices of the medication that they are suppose to take are unable to actually take them?
i can understand why hospitals tend to give a person a high amount in their bill. Alot of machines and medications are given so as to keep that person alive, but if only there were a way in which that amount could be reduced.
yes this is true, nurses tend to have years of knowledge and prep for this kind of work
More medical professional training. With the competitive and limited nature of nursing school, it becomes discouraging for those interested. If more and more nursing schools appeared, there would be more medical professionals as it pertains to nursing which would increase the volume. At the same time, that would cost more for people to stay, but with the principles of supply and demand, the more people that come in the hospital (not run away from the long emergency room lines) the less we'd have to pay for healthcare.
Limiting military healthcare. Many people take advantage of the "free" healthcare the military offers and go in for the slightest things such as a cough or a bruise, get medication they can buy at a drugstore. Also, some female spouses tend to pop out more babies because of the "free" healthcare.
Nurses to me already have a workload on them. They have a lot going on as it is. They do more in the sense that they're a caretaker. Doctors diagnose and such.
very true
We need to push more Nurse practitioners/Physician assistants before we push cheaper medical school. That is just how it is. Nurse practitioners do almost as much as a doctor would, yet it costs less to the hospital. The military healthcare system is shifting more towards to NP/PA route rather than doctors just due to the cost factor. It's cheaper to the hospital yet the NP/PA's get PAID.
Doctors really don't get paid as much as you'd think. Their salary is paying off their tuition for grad/med school as well as all the different types of insurance to cover them. On top of that, if they have a private practice, they have to pay for staffing and leasing the building and bill just on that- thus the reason they partner up. Eventually their salary pays off. But you get paid for the amount of work you put in. 12 years of school, you worked hard for that money so why strip it away? That's why it's not for everyone. If it were easy, everyone would be doing it.
Educationally wise, we need to push more nurse practitioners and physician's assistance.
The idea of universal healthcare is a good idea, however seeing how people "abuse" that liberty in the military sense (as far as dependents go) if that was more widespread, it wouldn't be good for our economy.
Finding a way for medication to be available at little to no cost for those in a life or death situation even if it's a long term situation.
A huge portion of nursing is people skills. I feel that an interviewing portion of the nursing SCHOOL application process would weed out those who don't have people skills.
Providing health care seminars to encourage those to join the health care profession.
Take the government out of the Healthcare system ASAP.
Universal HealthCare sounds good if it were not for illegals using all of the resources.
In order to cut cost for health care for AMERICANS, we need to stop giving free health care to those who are here illegally, on visas, or those who come for a short time for education. We as Americans pay way to much for those who take advantage of our system that was put there for the Legal American people.
Keep doctors from always getting sued.
If the Government would stop giving money to companies that make these products and then turn around and sell them back to the government for a huge amount of money. This would save cost.
If tax payers fund the research than the Tax payer should benefit from research..
Have cross state lines insurance.
Laws are not the answer. It is holding the insurance company accountable, but since most politicians receive funds from these companies, it is hard to hold them accountable.
Make a Law stating that no politician should receive funds from donors who control insurance companies or any other companies for that matter.
In most cases there are.
Health care should not be provided to over weight people, drug addicts, prisoners, illegals, those who want an abortion, and those who are not willing to pay taxes. This would make people think about there health more than ever.
The primary healthcare problem that is facing the healthcare system of this country is cost. As a member of the committee, my main concern is how we can generate ways to reduce the cost and at the same time still maintain high quality healthcare practice.   To me, preventive medicine would be a one of the primary areas we could reduce healthcare cost. "prevention is better than cure" to me is true in many aspects because a lot of health complications we have among our patients could have been prevented. For Example, it would cost less than $50.00 to get a flu shot but treating a flu patient would cost over $200.00 for patients who do not have insurance.  
That's what the current healthcare bill will do. Since its so expensive,which its not , most hospitals will have to reduce their prices because the government is stepping in. The prices are overly overpriced and should not be, the cost of chemo in other developed countries, is much lower than here in the US.
That problem deals with lobbying, or legal corruption, get rid of it and you'll see way more passionate people in office.
I agree to a point but, the reason its so expensive in the US is because the healthcare system has been virtually unwatched. The insurance companies have basically created an oligarchy which they all agree on a certain price for everything, which in return they all gain money. A flu shot in the UK is 10 dollars. The drastic influx of prices in the US is criminal, government needed to step in, just like when the government took down monopolies.
There should be a limit on how far, or how many times you can see a doctor. I know medicaid, only covers until a certain amount, pass it and you have to pay out of pocket. Make a limit well known and more people will use it wisely. however there is always people who abuse the system, the exact percentage would be unknown for obvious reasons.
I agree with preventative healthcare which also means some kind of workshop or information going out regarding how to prevent it. Things like cancer, however aren't as preventative (with the exception of maybe lung cancer or cancer brought on by a certain habit.)
I personally don't see how the government stays out of healthcare. If the government doesn't somewhat regulate it, then who will?
I honestly think in the financial sense, we'll have to use money to make money. We have research for a reason but research needs funding. Once this research hits a breaking point, then is where I think the cost of healthcare will go down. Until then, I find it difficult to think that it'll just go down automatically and everyone's health will be better.
I personally think that education is where a lot of these issues can end. If we start kids young learning good habits...
Due to the shortage of health care providers, I think that continuing education is a huge implementation to continue with because it forces those providers to stay up to date and knowledgeable.
More services available to legal low-income families.
Providing natural alternative ways for medical issues (not including hemp).
Refusal of healthcare is tricky because once someone refuses healthcare, say if they got in a car accident, the unknown trauma can effect them later. So maybe having some sort of consultation regardless can possibly reduce long-term effects.
If were asking to eliminate fraud then the government needs to step out of the equation. The government allows those who are in America illegally to receive care, which in turns makes prices go up. But since the govenment basically decides what it deams fraudulent then prices will never go down.
If you smoke- than you cannot receive healthcare for any known affects that smoking causes. If you became obese- You should not receive healthcare for known affects that obesity causes. If you will not find a job than healthcare should not be admitted to you. If you get pregnant before the age of 21 you should not receive healthcare. If you are here illegal, you should not receive healthcare. IF you are here for school only, you should not receive healthcare. All of these including more would make the cost of healthcare to go down.
If someone refuses healthcare than we all should respect that individuals right.
Funding mostly comes from the GOVERNMENT which really means TAXPAYERS, yet when the research is done, the companies who received all this funding then charges the TAXPAYERS outrageous prices. IF it comes from private funding than we have no say to what they can charge.
Regulation yes, determining who should receive a type of healthcare then no.
This current healthcare bill will do nothing of the sorts. Individual prices have soared.
In some sense I believe specialized care is key. At the same time, when you have 5 doctors in one room for a single patient, it's ridiculous/.
Emergency room services already have a priority system as it is, but I think that there should be an acute ER as well because when someone comes in with a head injury (possible concussion) or a fever...they're left there for a good 15-30 minutes because it may not seem like an emergency at the moment. Don't let a trauma 1 victim come in, because then everyone will be pushed back.
I honestly think that medications should be universally cheaper, especially for those who are on a fixed income. Even if it's the generic kind.
I don't feel it's fair to those who are elderly and/or impaired can't afford a knee replacement or other related injuries to have to suffer. I think there should be some way that they are able to get the assistance they need.
I love the idea that more places are transitioning to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) because it helps keep records more secure. I worked/volunteered at an office and I was able to just widely see the patient's information when I was putting paper work in. The only downside is the reliability of technology when computers act up at times.
I think there should be mandatory yearly mental health screenings (just as there are required shots) just because that's not something you usually think about.
Affordability, quality and accessibility are some of the characteristics of a good healthcare system. Quality;          Quality is one of the most important property of any healthcare system. In order to practice a great quality healthcare system, health practitioners (doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacist..... e.t.c)  must be well trained. This training might include educational learning like in medical schools and the ability to operate all kinds of tools, soft wares, and equipments needed to carryout their respective roles. This training should also include social skills like interpersonal skill, empathy, communication skills and critical thinking skills. Also, in order to provide better healthcare, healthcare facilities must be well equipped, easily accessible, and up to date in terms of modernization. Accessibility;      Apart from having a quality healthcare system, patients must be accessible to the quality care that is available whether they can afford it or not. To me I don't think that any thing wards someone's life; no matter their race, religion or ethnicity. I personally think it is very wrong to turn somebody down because they can not afford to pay. It is sad that a lot of people are being refused of prescription at the pharmacy because they can not pay for it and at the same time we can really blame those people in the pharmacy business.  I think the whole problem is systematic that every angle has a component to contribute to the healthcare problems we have.    
For one how  is the private sector going to do anything better. The people receiving the care, cannot hold the private sector accountable. Yet, you can always challenge the government when it does something wrong, its called supreme court cases. Second, it is inhumane to not give somebody healthcare because they are not a citizen of the US. Third it is the private companies that set the the price, the private sector is only concerned with profit, which in turn means worst financial strain on the care receiver.
That is one part of the healthcare system that neglects. For some reason,people seem to think it dosent really matter when psychologist constantly say it is.
Neglecting health care to anybody is immoral and also illegal according to human rights and,The UN. Doctors can't have prejudices, when treating a patient,no matter who they are. If a doctor denies you treatment, it is also against their code of ethics as well as the law.

having more doctors on hand in hospitals to ensure quicker response time to emergencies
one thing that would help America's healthcare system would be to limit the amount of lobbying the pharmaceutical companies can bride our elected officials.

stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate The United States when we have families here at home who cannot afford to eat or get a good education
eliminate the somewhat of a monopoly on healthcare over the people
prevent doctors from taking advantage of patients by having a board that oversees doctors offices in a certain area, possibly have a board of individuals that will review each case within each hospital
additionally allow the nurses to do more without having to have the doctor do it. The nurse should be trained to do the additional tasks though.
sanitation and personal hygiene should be taught at an early age to have a better understanding of the importance of cleanliness.
not allowing doctors to prescribe young individuals with medicines that could potentially harm the individual more than the problem they initially visited for was.
overall reduce the profitability of healthcare and force these establishments into putting the patient first rather than the almighty DOLLAR!
require doctors to explain different options of treatment rather than prescribing the patients with drugs. ex: rather than prescribing someone with medicine, the doctor could give the patient an alternative such as a change in diet, or a certain food group or a natural remedy that would be much more affordable.
having a universal database of information on each patient between every hospital and doctors office in the US would allow a faster treatment and would allow doctors to see what prior doctors and health professionals have prescribed the patient to see if it has worked or shouldn't be used again. Also allow the doctors to make little notes in the database on the patients such as allergies, or certain drugs that shouldn't be given to the patient.

Have background checks on doctors and see about their experiences. Doctors with hands on experience would be much better than one that did mainly paper and book work.
try to lower the cost of an appointment to those who don't have insurance.  paying about $100.00 for a 5 min conversation with a doctor doesn't seem right.

more roadsigns or billboards
Make sure that doctors are honest with people rather than being "light" with people when trying to them things such as about whether or not they are indeed overweight or other issues
try to recruit more teachers for nursing and med programs
raise pay for med program educators
monitor how nurses and doctors retrieve medicine, so as to avoid abuse of drugs
There needs to be a better standard of how medical care is and what is legal and illegal when it comes to what states rule as legal for the public. Many states have different views and state laws on particular medicines but instead it should be standardized across states.
The issue could come down to how connected with the public is states and other political figures that decide and change the rules and other things about the medical care of people.
take the money we use to fight this war with marijuana, and put it into healthcare budget.
However if the issue was to come down to whether or states and the government then that means it would be up to the people to voice their opinion about things such as medical care. If they were to do so they would needs to vote or at least be educated about such things. And a nations such as the US, there is also the issue of communicating the problem. So over all there is a lot of things that needs to be addressed if it were to come down to helping out and improving health care.
A lot of the government's money is also being drained when it come to inconsistency in medical practices or laws in different states.
minimize unnecessary care
such as early elective deliveries
TLDR; Pretty much it is all about educating people who can vote to make the change.
integrating more about our healthcare system into the curriculum of public schools
have more medically inclined people in government to make changes for the healthcare system.  They will be the ones who can make better informed decisions on what needs to be done in our healthcare system because they live that every day, as opposed to someone who is in the "out looking in"
additionally, have better direct routes and traffic flow to hospitals.
additionally, legalize the herb and tax it to hell like cigarettes. Use the taxes to pay for our own states healthcare.
lower the cost of ambulance transport.
state provide many more ambulances to hospitals to minimize the risk of fatality to a person due to a lack in number of ambulances.
provide more onsite care, if an EMS believes that the person should be fine without having to go to the hospital they should let the person know directly and provide them with information as to how to remedy the issue.
audit our whole federal government, and even state and local governments including military branches in search of financial waste. This financial waste should be used to finance the health of the people, reasonable security of the people, state and local utilities (transportation, government services) we should take care of the basics before attempting to take on excessive costs, as a normal family would do on a daily basis. Sit down see how much money we have coming in, pay for the necessities. Then whatever is left over can be used to finance  interests of the country as a whole.
and if sudden job loss resulting in less of no income, then provide with alternative options to keep health insurance ongoing
within financial means though
and the costs of an emergency room visit
ingrain healthy eating habits starting in elementary school so children grow up making better dietary choices
feed students in school healthier, nutrient-filled lunches rather than what's cheapest to make
have secretarial staff in the waiting room medically trained to an extent to where they can offer some aid to those with less urgency compared to those who are in more dire situations who are taken into the ER right away 
stop denying people with preexisting diseases medical insurance
make getting insurances to those with preexisting diseases easier and more affordable
teach young adults in high school how insurances works- premiums, benefits, the process of getting it/using it, etc...
have insurances focus on the health and need of their customers and not just focusing on the how much money ensuring insurance to their customers will make them
have fresh out of med school students develop relationships with mentors throughout their whole career so if they need advice on anything they have someone
have doctors go back to conferences to learn about new discoveries in the scientific/medical world so their knowledge is up to date with the new findings
have doctors build relationships with their patients
don't use pesticides on crops/find a way to grow crops naturally without any use of chemicals
have places selling fruits and vegetables post signs up regarding what chemicals were sprayed on them and the effects they could cause after consumption
if a patient's doctor is retiring within half a year (or withing an X amount of time), then the doctor should let them know asap and help his patient with finding a doctor they are comfortable/suitable with
Change the condition of schools. What I mean by that is have schools and other places of education go through reforms such as removal of soda and snack machines that why children and adults do not have access to unhealthy food. This a step towards having people less likely to go to hospitals down the road from an unhealthy diet.
Reform the educational system in schools, many adults who are teaching Health classes are mainly P.E. teachers or coaches who were forced to teach Health classes. By doing this, many times these "Health teachers" are putting half efforts just so that they can get through the Health classes they have to teach and go back to doing what they really wanted to do. By having actual trained and educated people working in the position of Health teacher rather than P.E. teachers or coaches of sports, then maybe children would be better educated about health and be more aware of what they're eating.
Make it like the Baylor Hospital chains; they don't have any sodas in the hospital except for a very small bottle sold in the gift shop.
Make vegetables and healthy foods cheaper than a 1.00 McDouble
Teach students about the different types of caloric diets
To further touch on education, perhaps it should start at the national level in which the government should help fund schools. A better educated population will help out overall in the long run. Most schools are forced to cut funding to projects and classes resulting in lack of better education for students in places such as hands on things and health.
make all fast food restaurants show you the dietary facts about their food
let consumers know how their food is processed/made if consumers ask
make children in school take more than one health class in four years of high school. there should be at least one health class per each academic school year
if they don't want to take health classes in high school give them the option of taking a yoga/pilate/crosfit/zumba class (something to keep them active)
somehow remove the stigma of retirement homes
make information about how to obtain long term care available.
make clinics to those who do not have insurance a little bit more affordable
try to make medicine from the pharmacy more affordable
make pharmaceuticals more regulated
teach children in junior high school and high school all about health care while they're young so when they have to deal with it in the future, they are well prepared on how to handle healthcare issues
have our nation look at other country's who have better healthcare policies and see what America can do to tweek ours to be better than what it is now
look at where all finances are going with regard to healthcare and then RE-finance the money to better allocate it so we don't waste it on programs we don't need or over fund so we can fund the under funded programs
have local leaders who the communities can voice their concerns to and he/she will voice them to those who can fix/help with the problems arising
have a segment of the news that informs the public of any changes of the healthcare system that is important for the general public to know
explore more of other countries' technology so as to further ours
have more surveillance in hospital rooms, to avoid any abuse of any kind
regulate finances of a hospital so as to make sure it's more for the better of mankind than solely profit
make it harder for people to claim mentally insane when faced with a criminal charge
reform our educational system in a way that once someone enters high school (after their freshman year so they can get a feel for how school is) they are forced to choose whether they want to further pursue a college degree or enter the work force right out of school. After freshman year (beginning of sophomore year) each student will have to choose whether to branch off into a further educational process such as teaching more complex mathematics, sciences, and histories this type of path would be more suited for someone  wanting to continue their education past high school. On the contrary the second branch would be more workforce driven such as have classes to explore the different types of jobs available with a high school diploma, classes teaching everyday needs such as setting up insurance, saving money on groceries (smart Shopping), personal preventive care (how to take care of yourself and dependents), home ec classes, and also have different trade skills students could pursue in high school. There would be some overlay in subjects such as personal preventive care, job search techniques, and more. For far too long have I seen students in high school being taught math and science they never use in day to day activities when they don't even plan to go to college this education of these subjects to people who choose to enter the workforce waste so much time doing this that they have to wait and have no experience in how to get the jobs and once they do get the job they don't know how to do the required tasks in an adequate manner.
Health needs to be acessisble to everyone who needs it in the US.
Everyone needs better knowledge about the current state of Healthcare and what needs to be done for the people.
In the school system the understand about health and medical issues should be addressed either classes or other means.
Parents should also be informed about healthcare or adults in general so that people can fully be aware about it and inform or educate other people. Things tend to spread faster when people talk about it.
When it comes to the news, somethings should be addressed on there as well not just international news but also local and national and thing that really matter.
Compared to nations around the world, US falls behind in many things such as education and the health of people, perhaps it is best to address this so that maybe healthcare and things related to medical issues can have less of a workload.
On the same note about the health of people in the US, perhaps the path to all natural food with no chemicals or modified food should be told to people and perhaps then it would better the health of the people in the US.
To better inform people about issues in Healthcare, perhaps access to internet or TV should be easily obtained.
Negative influences of junk food and "lazy actives" should be addressed and taken careful so that way children won't be on the path to a bad life style or health.
Understanding the what happens behind the scene with things that large companies that advertise and sell junk food should be made clear and aware to the public.
On that same note, by doing so people can help themselves in that sense and better the lifestyle choices.
Perhaps the issues of schools and their educational system or even the way schools are funded (or lack of funding) can be the issue.
Perhaps the environment and where people live can influence the situation and how people better take care of themselves. For example older neighborhoods or places of low income families tend to lack access to near by parks and recreational areas compared to newer homes that are planned out with parks and even a place to swim.
If funding were to be put into educational systems then perhaps public schools would be much better suited to educate children and provide them with things that they would not normally receive especially in low income neighborhoods.
When the issue of healthcare arises, it's hard for people to voice their opinions about it. If there was perhaps an easier way for people to comment on it and then perhaps there would be change.
It is not enough for people to just see it on TV or read it on a newspaper, many times people would acknowledge it but never really do anything about it or put it off for another time. Very few people would put out the effort to make a change.
On the same issue, many times it is people of different ethnicity that are shy or fearful to approach people government official, this should be addressed.
